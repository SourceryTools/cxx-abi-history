<font color=blue>[990610 All]</font>
Given the absence of addressing modes with displacements on IA-64,
the consensus is to answer this question with "first."

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
Given a Vptr and only non-polymorphic bases,
which (Vptr or base) goes at offset 0?
<ul>
<li> HP: Vptr at end, but IA-64 is different because no load displacement
<li> Sun: Vptr at 0 probably preferred
<li> g++: Vptr at end today
</ul>
<p>
Tentative decision:  Vptr always goes at beginning.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Accepted tentative decision.
Rename, close this issue, and open separate issue (B-6) for Vtable layout.

Where are the virtual base subobjects placed in the class layout?

</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 Matt]</font>
With regard to how data member accesses are handled,
the choices are to store either a pointer or an offset in the Vtable.
The concensus seems to be to prefer an offset.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
Any number of empty virtual base subobjects (rare) will be placed at
offset zero.
If there are no non-virtual polymorphic bases,
the first virtual base subobject with a Vpointer will be placed at
offset zero.
Finally, all other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Define an empty object as one with no non-static, non-empty data members,
no virtual functions,
no virtual base classes,
and no non-empty non-virtual base classes.
Define a nearly empty object as one which contains only a Vptr.
The above resolution is accepted, restated as follows:

<p>
Any number of empty virtual base subobjects
(rare, because they cannot have virtual functions or bases themselves)
will be placed at offset zero, subject to the conflict rules in A-3
(i.e. this cannot result in two objects of the same type at the same
address).
If there are no non-virtual polymorphic base subobjects,
the first nearly empty virtual base subobject will be placed at offset zero.
Any virtual base subobjects not thus placed at offset zero will be
allocated at the end of the class,
in left-to-right, depth-first declaration order.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
At offset zero is the Vptr whenever there is one,
as well as the primary base class if any (see A-7).
Also at offset zero is any number of empty base classes,
as long as that does not place multiple subobjects of the same type at
the same offset.
If there are multiple empty base classes such that placing two of them
at offset zero would violate this constraint, the first is placed there.
(First means in declaration order.)

<p>
All other non-virtual base classes are laid out in declaration order at
the beginning of the class.
All other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
The above ignores issues of padding for alignment,
and possible reordering of class members to fit in padding areas.
See issue A-9.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
There remains an issue concerning the selection of the primary base
class (see A-7), but we are otherwise in agreement.
We will attempt to close this on 1 July, modulo A-7.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
This issue is closed.
A full description of the class layout can be found in issue A-9.
(At this time, A-7 remains to be closed,
waiting for the Taligent rationale.)

<b>Summary</b>:
When passing a parameter with an empty class type by value,
what is the convention?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990623 SGI]</font>
We propose that no parameter slot be allocated to such parameters,
i.e. that no register be used,
and that no space in the parameter memory sequence be used.
This implies that the callee must allocate storage at a unique address
if the address is taken (which we expect to be rare).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
In addition to the address-taken case,
care is required if the object has a non-trivial copy constructor.
HP observes that in (some?) such cases,
they perform the construction at the call site and pass the object by
reference.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990625 SGI -- Jim]</font>
I understand that the Standard explicitly allows elimination of
even non-trivial copy construction in some cases.
Is this one of them?  Where should I look?
Also, of course, varargs processing for elided empty parameters would
need to be careful.

<p>
I have opened a new issue (C-7) for passing copy-constructed
parameters by reference.
Since doing so would turn an empty value parameter
into a non-empty reference parameter,
this issue can ignore such cases.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
An empty parameter will not occupy a slot in the parameter sequence
unless:
<ol>
<li> its type is a class with a non-trivial copy constructor; or
<li> it corresponds to the variable part of a varargs parameter list.
</ol>

<p>
Daveed and Matt will pursue the question of when copy constructors may
be ignored for parameters with the Core committee,
and if they identify cases where the constructors may clearly be
omitted, those (empty) parameters will also be elided.

<b>Summary</b>:
A (virtual) base class may have a larger alignment constraint than a
derived class.
Do we agree to extend the alignment constraint to the derived class?
(An alternative for virtual bases:
allow the virtual base to move in the complete object.)

<p>
<font color=blue>[990623 SGI]</font>
We propose that the alignment of a class be the maximum alignment of
its virtual and non-virtual base classes,
non-static data members, and Vptr if any.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Above proposal accepted.
(SGI observation:
the size of the class is rounded up to a multiple of this alignment,
per the underlying psABI rules.)

<b>Summary</b>:
The standard constrains ordering of class members in memory only if
they are not separated by an access clause.
Do we use an access clause as an opportunity to fill the gaps left by padding?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 all]</font>
Some participants want to avoid attempts to reorder members differently
than the underlying C struct ABI rules.
Others think there may be benefit in reordering later access sections
to fill holes in earlier ones, or even in base classes.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 all]</font>
There are several potential reordering questions, more or less independent:
<ol>
<li> Do we reorder whole access regions relative to one another?
<li> Do we attempt to fill padding in earlier access regions with
	initial members from later regions?
<li> Do we fill the tail padding of non-POD base classes with members from
	the current class?
<li> Do we attempt to fill interior padding of non-POD base classes with later
	members?
</ol>

<p>
There is no apparent support for (1),
since no simple heuristic has been identified with obvious benefits.
There is interest in (2), based on a simple heuristic which might
sometimes help and will never hurt.
However, it is not clear that it will help much,
and Sun objects on grounds that they prefer to match C struct layout.
Unless someone is interested enough to implement and run experiments,
this will be hard to agree upon.
G++ has implemented (3) as an option,
based on specific user complaints.
It clearly helps HP's example of a base class containing a word and flag,
with a derived class adding more flags.
Idea (4) has more problems, including some non-intuitive (to users) layouts,
and possibly complicating the selection of bitwise copy in the compiler.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 all]</font>
We will not do (1), (2), or (4).  We will do (3).
Specifically, allocation will be in modified declaration order as follows:
<ol>
<li> Vptr if any, and the primary base class per A-7.
<li> Any empty base classes allocated at offset zero per A-3.
<li> Any remaining non-virtual base classes.
<li> Any non-static data members.
<li> Any remaining virtual base classes.
</ol>
Each subobject allocated is placed at the next available position that
satisfies its alignment constraints, as in the underlying psABI.
This is interpreted with the following special cases:
<ol>
<li> The "next available position" after a non-POD class subobject
	(base class or data member) with tail padding is at the
	beginning of the tail padding, not after it.
	(For POD objects, the tail padding is not "available.")
<li> Empty classes are considered to have alignment and size 1,
	consisting solely of one byte of tail padding.
<li> Placement on top of the tail padding of an empty class must avoid
	placing multiple subobjects of the same type at the same
	address.
</ol>
After allocation is complete,
the size is rounded up to a multiple of alignment (with tail padding).

<b>Summary</b>:
The C ABI specifies that structs are passed in registers.
Does this apply to small non-POD C++ objects passed by value?
What about the copy constructor and <code>this</code> pointer in that case?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 all]</font>
A separate issue (C-7) deals with cases where a non-trivial copy
constructor is required; we ignore those cases here.
Our conclusion is that, without a non-trivial copy constructor,
we need not be concerned about the class object moving in the process
of being passed, and there is no need to use a mechanism different from
the base ABI C struct mechanism.
At the same time, if we do use the underlying C struct mechanism,
the user has complete control of the passing technique,
by choosing whether to pass by value or reference/pointer.

<p>
Therefore, except in cases identified by issue C-7 for different treatment,
class parameters will be passed using the underlying C struct protocol.

<b>Summary</b>:
It is possible to pass small classes either as memory images,
as is specified by the base ABI for C structs,
or as a sequence of parameters, one for each member.
Which should be done, and if the latter,
what are the rules for identifying "small" classes?
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Resolution</b>:
No special treatment will be specified by the ABI.
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 all]</font>
Define no special treatment for this case in the ABI.
A translator with control over both caller and callee may choose to optimize.
