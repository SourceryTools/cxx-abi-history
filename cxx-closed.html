Given the absence of addressing modes with displacements on IA-64,
the consensus is to answer this question with "first."

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
Given a Vptr and only non-polymorphic bases,
which (Vptr or base) goes at offset 0?
<ul>
<li> HP: Vptr at end, but IA-64 is different because no load displacement
<li> Sun: Vptr at 0 probably preferred
<li> g++: Vptr at end today
</ul>
<p>
Tentative decision:  Vptr always goes at beginning.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Accepted tentative decision.
Rename, close this issue, and open separate issue (B-6) for Vtable layout.

</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 Matt]</font>
With regard to how data member accesses are handled,
the choices are to store either a pointer or an offset in the Vtable.
The concensus seems to be to prefer an offset.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
Any number of empty virtual base subobjects (rare) will be placed at
offset zero.
If there are no non-virtual polymorphic bases,
the first virtual base subobject with a Vpointer will be placed at
offset zero.
Finally, all other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Define an empty object as one with no non-static, non-empty data members,
no virtual functions,
no virtual base classes,
and no non-empty non-virtual base classes.
Define a nearly empty object as one which contains only a Vptr.
The above resolution is accepted, restated as follows:

<p>
Any number of empty virtual base subobjects
(rare, because they cannot have virtual functions or bases themselves)
will be placed at offset zero, subject to the conflict rules in A-3
(i.e. this cannot result in two objects of the same type at the same
address).
If there are no non-virtual polymorphic base subobjects,
the first nearly empty virtual base subobject will be placed at offset zero.
Any virtual base subobjects not thus placed at offset zero will be
allocated at the end of the class,
in left-to-right, depth-first declaration order.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
At offset zero is the Vptr whenever there is one,
as well as the primary base class if any (see A-7).
Also at offset zero is any number of empty base classes,
as long as that does not place multiple subobjects of the same type at
the same offset.
If there are multiple empty base classes such that placing two of them
at offset zero would violate this constraint, the first is placed there.
(First means in declaration order.)

<p>
All other non-virtual base classes are laid out in declaration order at
the beginning of the class.
All other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
The above ignores issues of padding for alignment,
and possible reordering of class members to fit in padding areas.
See issue A-9.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
There remains an issue concerning the selection of the primary base
class (see A-7), but we are otherwise in agreement.
We will attempt to close this on 1 July, modulo A-7.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
This issue is closed.
A full description of the class layout can be found in issue A-9.
(At this time, A-7 remains to be closed,
waiting for the Taligent rationale.)

<b>Summary</b>:
When passing a parameter with an empty class type by value,
what is the convention?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990623 SGI]</font>
We propose that no parameter slot be allocated to such parameters,
i.e. that no register be used,
and that no space in the parameter memory sequence be used.
This implies that the callee must allocate storage at a unique address
if the address is taken (which we expect to be rare).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
In addition to the address-taken case,
care is required if the object has a non-trivial copy constructor.
HP observes that in (some?) such cases,
they perform the construction at the call site and pass the object by
reference.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990625 SGI -- Jim]</font>
I understand that the Standard explicitly allows elimination of
even non-trivial copy construction in some cases.
Is this one of them?  Where should I look?
Also, of course, varargs processing for elided empty parameters would
need to be careful.

<p>
I have opened a new issue (C-7) for passing copy-constructed
parameters by reference.
Since doing so would turn an empty value parameter
into a non-empty reference parameter,
this issue can ignore such cases.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
An empty parameter will not occupy a slot in the parameter sequence
unless:
<ol>
<li> its type is a class with a non-trivial copy constructor; or
<li> it corresponds to the variable part of a varargs parameter list.
</ol>

<p>
Daveed and Matt will pursue the question of when copy constructors may
be ignored for parameters with the Core committee,
and if they identify cases where the constructors may clearly be
omitted, those (empty) parameters will also be elided.

Daveed will put together a proposal by the 15th (action #13);
the group will discuss it on the 22nd.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990805 All]</font>
Daveed should have his proposal together for discussion.
Michael Lam will look into the Sun dynamic cast algorithm.

<p>
It was noted that appropriate name selection along with the normal
DSO global name resolution should be sufficient to produce a unique
address for each class' RTTI struct,
which address would then be a suitable identifier for comparisons.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 Sun -- Michael]</font>
Sun has provided a description,
<a href=Sun-RTTI-990812.html>in a separate page</a>,
describing their implementation.
They are filing for a patent on the algorithms described.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990819 EDG -- Daveed]</font>
(Proposal replaced by later version on 6 October.)

<p>
<font color=blue>[990826 All]</font>
Discussion centered on whether the representation should include all
base classes or just the direct ones,
and in the former case how hashing might be handled.
It was agreed that the __qualifier_type_info variant is not needed,
and it is now striken in the above proposal.
Also, a pointer-to-member variant is needed.
Christophe will provide a description of the HP hashing approach,
and Daveed will update the specification.

<p>
<h5>Run-time type information</h5>

<p>
The C++ programming language definition implies that information about
types be available at run time for three distinct purposes:
<ol type=a>
<li> to support the typeid operator,
<li> to match an exception handler with a thrown object, and
<li> to implement the dynamic_cast operator.
</ol>
(c) only requires type information about polymorphic class types,
but (a) and (b) may apply to other types as well;
for example, when a pointer to an int is thrown,
it can be caught by a handler that catches "int const*".


<p>
<h5>Deliberations</h5>
<p>
The following conclusions were arrived at by the attending members of
the C++ IA-64 ABI group:

<ul>
<p>
<li> The exact layout for type_info objects is dependent on whether a
    32-bit or 64-bit model is supported.
<p>
<li> Advantage should be taken of COMDAT sections and symbol preemption:
    two type_info pointers point to equivalent types if and only if the
    pointers are equal.
<p>
<li> A simple dynamic_cast algorithm that is efficient in the common
    case of base-to-most-derived cast case is preferrable over more
    sophisticated ideas that handle deep-base-to-in-between-derived
    casts more efficiently at a slight cost to the common case.
    Hence, the original scheme of providing a hash-table into the
    list of base classes
    (as is done e.g. in the HP aC++ compiler)
    has been dropped.
<p>
<li> The GNU egcs development team has implemented an idea of this ABI
    group to accelerate dynamic_cast operations by a-posteriori
    checking a "likely outcome".
    The interface of std::__dynamic_cast therefore keeps the
    src2dst_offset hint.
<p>
<li> std::__extended_type_info is dropped.
</ul>

<p>
The full proposal has been incorporated in the
<a href=abi-layout.html#rtti>ABI data layout document</a>.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[991014 all]</font>
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Do we keep pointers to direct bases only, or to indirect bases as well?
It is believed that keeping pointers to indirect bases speeds
up dynamic_cast by a constant factor,
but at the cost of extra space even when dynamic_cast is never used.
There is a general preference for keeping direct bases only.

<p>
<li>
The current proposal has a flag to differentiate single
inheritance from multiple inheritance case.
Jason suggests instead splitting the two cases into two separate classes,
and there was general agreement that this is a good idea.

<p>
<li>
The current proposal has separate classes for various kinds of
non-class types.
Jason suggests merging all non-class types into a single class.
Nobody had strong feelings,
or strong arguments either for or against this change.
In the absence of a consensus in favor of this change,
we'll keep the proposal as is.

<p>
<li>
Minor changes:
There's a typo in the pointer to member part, which Daveed will fix.
Jason suggests flipping the sign on the offset, and nobody objected.
</ol>

<p>
ACTION ITEMS: Daveed---make these changes.  Jim---incorporate these
changes into the open issues list.  We are almost ready to close this
issue; we intend to close it at the 28 October meeting, after we've
all had a change to go over the modified writeup.


<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[991028 all]</font>
The current definition,
in the <a href=abi-layout.html#rtti>ABI data layout document</a>,
has been updated with Daveed's changes,
and is accepted.
Note that we are back to using a pointer to RTTI in the vtable
(see B-8), since we need uniqueness,
and since we need an external symbol in any case,
the ABI will make no statement about where RTTI is allocated.
It is likely that implementations will use COMDAT for it.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
HP noted that Taligent chooses a base class with virtual bases before
one without as the primary base class),
probably to avoid additional "this" pointer adjustments.
SGI observed that such a rule would prevent users from controlling the
choice by their ordering of the base classes in the declaration.
The bias of the group remains the above resolution,
but HP will attempt to find the Taligent rationale before this is decided.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990729 All]</font>
Close with the agree resolution.
If a convincing Taligent rationale is found, we can reconsider.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 all]</font>
Some participants want to avoid attempts to reorder members differently
than the underlying C struct ABI rules.
Others think there may be benefit in reordering later access sections
to fill holes in earlier ones, or even in base classes.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 all]</font>
There are several potential reordering questions, more or less independent:
<ol>
<li> Do we reorder whole access regions relative to one another?
<li> Do we attempt to fill padding in earlier access regions with
	initial members from later regions?
<li> Do we fill the tail padding of non-POD base classes with members from
	the current class?
<li> Do we attempt to fill interior padding of non-POD base classes with later
	members?
</ol>

<p>
There is no apparent support for (1),
since no simple heuristic has been identified with obvious benefits.
There is interest in (2), based on a simple heuristic which might
sometimes help and will never hurt.
However, it is not clear that it will help much,
and Sun objects on grounds that they prefer to match C struct layout.
Unless someone is interested enough to implement and run experiments,
this will be hard to agree upon.
G++ has implemented (3) as an option,
based on specific user complaints.
It clearly helps HP's example of a base class containing a word and flag,
with a derived class adding more flags.
Idea (4) has more problems, including some non-intuitive (to users) layouts,
and possibly complicating the selection of bitwise copy in the compiler.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 all]</font>
We will not do (1), (2), or (4).  We will do (3).
Specifically, allocation will be in modified declaration order as follows:
<ol>
<li> Vptr if any, and the primary base class per A-7.
<li> Any empty base classes allocated at offset zero per A-3.
<li> Any remaining non-virtual base classes.
<li> Any non-static data members.
<li> Any remaining virtual base classes.
</ol>
Each subobject allocated is placed at the next available position that
satisfies its alignment constraints, as in the underlying psABI.
This is interpreted with the following special cases:
<ol>
<li> The "next available position" after a non-POD class subobject
	(base class or data member) with tail padding is at the
	beginning of the tail padding, not after it.
	(For POD objects, the tail padding is not "available.")
<li> Empty classes are considered to have alignment and size 1,
	consisting solely of one byte of tail padding.
<li> Placement on top of the tail padding of an empty class must avoid
	placing multiple subobjects of the same type at the same
	address.
</ol>
After allocation is complete,
the size is rounded up to a multiple of alignment (with tail padding).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990722 all]</font>
The precise placement of empty bases when they don't fit at offset zero
remained imprecise in the original description.
Accordingly, a precise layout algorithm is described in
a separate writeup of <a href=abi-layout.html#class-types>Data Layout</a>.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990729 all]</font>
The layout writeup was accepted,
with the first choice for empty base placement.
That is, if placement at offset zero doesn't work,
it will be placed like a normal base/member.
The concensus was that this won't happen often,
and such bases will often overlap with the preceding tail padding or
following components anyway.
Jim will modify the writeup accordingly.

<font color=blue>[990701 all]</font>
A separate issue (C-7) deals with cases where a non-trivial copy
constructor is required; we ignore those cases here.
Our conclusion is that, without a non-trivial copy constructor,
we need not be concerned about the class object moving in the process
of being passed, and there is no need to use a mechanism different from
the base ABI C struct mechanism.
At the same time, if we do use the underlying C struct mechanism,
the user has complete control of the passing technique,
by choosing whether to pass by value or reference/pointer.

<p>
Therefore, except in cases identified by issue C-7 for different treatment,
class parameters will be passed using the underlying C struct protocol.

Jason described the g++ implementation, which is a three-member struct:
<ol>
<li> The adjustment to <i>this</i>.
<li> The Vtable index plus one of the function, or -1.
     (Zero is a NULL pointer.)
<li> If (2) is an index, the offset from the full object to the member
     function's Vtable.  If -1, a pointer to the function (non-virtual).
</ol>

<p>
A concern about covariant returns was raised.
It was observed that, given our decision to use distinct Vtable entries
for distinct return types, no further concern is required here.
Others will describe their representations.
IBM has an alternative, but it is believed to be patented by Microsoft.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990805 All]</font>
It is agreed that a two-element struct will be used for a pointer to a
member function, with elements as follows:

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>ptr</code>:
<dd> For a non-virtual function, this field is a simple function pointer.
     (Under current base IA-64 psABI conventions,
     this is a pointer to a GP/function address pair.)
     For a virtual function,
     it is 1 plus twice the Vtable offset of the function.
     The value zero is a NULL pointer.

<p>
<dt> <code>adj</code>:
<dd> The required adjustment to <i>this</i>.
</dl>

<p>
Although we agreed to close this, SGI suggests a minor modification.
Since the Vtable offset of a virtual function will always be even,
we suggest that it not be doubled before adding 1.
This is because shifts are more restricted on many processors than
other integer ALU operations (shifters are large structures),
so an XOR or NAND will often be cheaper than a right shift.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 All]</font>
Close this issue with the suggested modification.

A separate issue raised in conjunction with A-7 is whether to include
Vfunc pointers in the primary Vtable for functions defined only in the
base classes and not overridden.
If the primary and secondary Vtables are concatenated,
this is no longer an issue,

All of the Vtables associated with a class will be concatenated,
and a single external symbol used
(to be identified as part of the mangling issue F-1).
The order of the tables will be the same as the order of base class
subobjects in an object of the class,
i.e. first the primary Vtable,
then the non-virtual base classes in declaration order,
and finally the virtual base classes in depth-first declaration order.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 Matt]</font>
One possibility is to have two Vtable entries,
which might point to different functions, different entrypoints,
or a real entrypoint and a thunk.
Another is to return two result pointers (base/derived),
and have the caller select the right one.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Daveed presented his multiple-return-value scheme,
including an example that involved virtual base classes,
return values that are pointers to nonpolymorphic classes,
and other equally horrible things.

<p>
Consensus: we need to get the horrible cases correct,
but speed only matters in the simple case.
The simple case: class B has a virtual function f returning a B1*
and class D has a virtual function f returning a D1*,
where all four classes are polymorphic,
B is a primary base of D, and B1 is a primary base of D1.
(The really important case is where B1 is B and D1 is D,
but that simplification doesn't make any difference.)

<p>
Jason: Would the usual multiple-entry-point scheme work just as well?
That is, would it be just as fast as Daveed's scheme in the simple case,
and still preserve enough information for the more complicated cases?
It appears so, but we don't have a proof.
Jason will try to provide one.


<p>
<font color=blue>[990716 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
Proof?
You always know what types a given override must be able to return,
and you know how to convert from the return type to those base types.
You know from the entry point which type is desired.
Seems pretty straightforward to me.



<p>
<font color=blue>[990716 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
The alternative I was talking about yesterday goes something like this:

<p>
When we have a non-trivial covariant return situation,
we create a new entry in the vtable for the new return type.
The caller chooses which vtable entry to use based on the type they want.

<p>
This could be implemented several ways,
at the discretion of the vendor:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
Multiple entry points to one function,
with an internal flag indicating which type to return.
<p>
<li>
Thunks which intercept the function's return and modify the return value.
Note that unlike the case of calling virtual functions,
for covariant returns we always know which adjustments will be needed,
so we don't have to pay for a long branch.
We do, however, lose the 1-1 correspondence between calls and returns,
which apparently affects performance on the Pentium Pro.
<p>
<li>
Function duplication.
</ol>

<p>
The advantage of this approach to the complex case is that we don't have to
do a dynamic_cast when faced with multiple levels of virtual derivation.
It is also strictly simpler;
Daveed's model already requires something like
this in cases of multiple inheritance.

<p>
Of course, we can always mix and match;
we could choose to only do this in cases of virtual inheritance,
or use Daveed's proposal and do this only in
cases of repeated virtual inheritance.
In that case, the multiple returns
would just be an optimization for the single virtual inheritance case.

<p>
Since we don't seem to care about the performance of
anything but single nonvirtual inheritance,
it seems simpler not to bother with multiple returns.

<p>
The remaining question is how to handle the case of nontrivial
nonvirtual inheritance:
do we use multiple slots or have the caller do the adjustment?
My inclination is to have the caller adjust.

<p>
WRT patents,
the idea of having the function return the base-most class and having
the caller adjust is parallel to the patented Microsoft scheme whereby
they pass the base-most class as the 'this' argument to virtual functions,
but the word 'return' does not appear anywhere in the patent,
so it seems safe.


<p>
<font color=blue>[990722 All]</font>
The group was generally agreed that the simplicity of multiple entries
in the vtable outweighed any space/performance advantage of more
complex schemes (e.g. the method Daveed described on 15 July).
Discussion focussed on whether it is worthwhile to eliminate some of
the entries in cases where they are unnecessary because the caller
knows the required conversion,
namely when the return type has a unique non-virtual subobject of the
original return type.

<p>
Agreement was reached to avoid the complication of eliminating some of
the Vtable entries.
Thus, the Vtable will have one entry for each accessible return type of
a covariant virtual function.
These may be implemented in a variety of ways,
e.g. duplicated functions, separate entrypoints, or stubs,
and the ABI need not specify the choice.
The location of the Vtable entries is part of the separate Vtable
layout issue B-6.

Mike (Ball) gave me what I believe is an excellent definition of  
when caching is allowed.  I'd like him to present it.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990805 All]</font>
Christophe explained that the rule is simply that,
within a call to a member function of the class,
the class Vtable may not be modified.
Between such calls, no assumption may be made.
With this observation, the issue is closed.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 All]</font>
The rule is even simpler.
Once a program changes the type of a pointer's target,
the pointer is invalidated, and its value may not be reused.
Therefore, a code sequence which repeatedly refers to the same pointer
value is invalid if the pointee's vtable has been changed.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991007 IBM -- Brian]</font>
A while ago Jason was worried about COM compatibility.
Part of that is to ensure that vtables can be expressed in C.
But the resolution of issue B-4 says that a vtable contains
function descriptors rather than function descriptor pointers.

<p>
From the standpoint of call performance that is a good thing,
but the result can't be built in C.
I know that we at least will also have to rewrite parts of our
C++ runtime that hand-build vtables.
Neither of these are critical for IBM but may be for others.

<font color=blue>[990811 SGI -- Jim]</font>
I've put a reworked version of Christophe's writeup in the
<a href=abi-layout.html#vtable>data layout document</a>,
along with a number of questions it raises.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 All]</font>
Extensive discussion of this issue produced the observations that
<ul>
<li> The number of virtual base offsets changes for vtables
    embedded in derived vtables.
<li> Therefore, one cannot reference one by a compile-time-constant
    offset from another (within the set associated with a type).
<li> Therefore, one cannot omit vfunc pointers from a derived vtable
    just because they appear in one of the base class vtables.
</ul>
Christophe will look at the implications of these observations.
Others should too.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990820 IBM -- Brian]</font>

<p>
<h5> Re: vtable layout, sharing vtable offsets </h5>
<p>
I'm going to write the exam on this to see how well I
am understanding the issue.

<p>
If I understand it correctly,
the proposal under consideration is tied to the decision to replicate
virtual function entries in vtables.
It requires replicating in the vtable for base class B all virtual functions
that are overridden in B; more replication that this implies will
be wasted since a function is always called through a vtable
of an introducing or overriding class.

<p>
When a non-pure virtual function X::f() is compiled it is possible to
determine whether it requires a secondary entry point.
It will require one if that function may be virtually called
(i.e., is the final overrider)
in any class in which f() appears in more than one vtable;
this needs to be decidable knowing only X.
A rule that works is: X::f() overrides one or more f()'s
from base classes of X,
and either one or more of those base classes are
virtual or X fails to share its vptr with all instances of them.

<p>
[Though a virtual base may happen to share its vptr with X
in an object of complete type X,
that relationship may fail to hold in further derived classes,
so we need to generate the secondary entry point just in case.]
["Sharing a vptr" is the condition under which no adjustment is necessary;
if the bases involved are all nonvirtual then
subsequent class derivation won't change this.]

<p>
Each vtable that requires a nonzero adjustment will have a
"convert to X" offset mixed in with its virtual base offsets.
 It is necessary that a "convert to X" appears in the same position in
each vtable that references X::f()'s secondary entry;
it is desirable that the "convert to X" also be unique in each vtable.

<p>
Assume that X has nonvirtual nonprimary bases Nx (x=1,2,...),
and virtual bases Vx, all of which have a virtual f().
Then vtables for Nx in X,
or in anyclass derived from X that does not further override f(),
will reference X::f()'s secondary entry.
Vtables for Vx in X or any derived class where Vx
does not share a vptr with X,
will also reference X::f()'s secondary entry;
note this will occur in a construction vtable even if the
derived class does further override f().

<p>
The question, then,
is whether a position for the "convert to X" offset can be chosen,
knowing only X and its parentage,
that can be used consistently in all those vtables and that won't
collide with a "convert to Y" position chosen on account of some other
hierarchy where Y::g() overrides an Nx::g() or Vx::g().

<p>
If Y derives from X,
we will be able to select a "convert to Y" position that doesn't conflict,
so we can restrict our attention to cases where X and Y are unrelated.
Also, if the base involved is nonvirtual (Nx) then we are safe,
because no instance of Nx will be a subobject of both X and Y,
so no Nx vtable will require both "convert to X" and "convert to Y" offsets.

<p>
The remaining case is where X and Y are unrelated but both have
a virtual base Vx:

<code><pre>
struct V1 { virtual void f();  virtual void g(); };
struct Other1 { virtual void ignore1(); }
struct X : Other1, virtual V1 { virtual void f(); }

struct Y : Other1, virtual V1 { virtual void g(); }

struct ZZ: X, Y { }
</pre></code>

<p>
The vtable for N1 in ZZ does require both offsets.
The only way I see to accomplish this is to preallocate
an adjustment slot for each virtual function in V1.
 That is, X::f() uses the first slot position, and Y::g() the second,
based on the order that f() and g() are declared in V1.
This only needs to be done in hierarchies where V1 is virtual,
but the same offset has to be used for any Nx tables in X too.

<p>
Is this close?

<p>
<h5>Re: Concatenating vtables</h5>
<p>
I don't understand the comment that varying numbers of virtual
base offsets make it impossible to concatenate vtables and refer
to them via a single symbol.
The only code that refers by name to X's vtable and the vtables
of N1 in X etc. is X's constructor and destructor,
and maybe some derived classes that find they are able to reuse some pieces.
All that code is aware of X's declaration and can map out its tables.
What am I missing?

<p>
<font color=blue>[990826 All]</font>
There is still considerable confusion about what will work.
Key questions are
(1) whether member functions can share offsets to base classes,
or each need their own; and
(2) when we need a no-this-adjustment override entry.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990901 SGI -- Jim]</font>
Being confused myself by all the discussion,
I've constructed a <a href=cxx-vtable-ex.html>new page</a>
containing (initially)
an example of a class hierarchy supplied by Christophe,
and attempted to identify possible function calls,
the class data layout,
and the class vtable layout based on Christophe's original proposal.
Please provide corrections,
and if you're proposing alternative vtable constructions,
describing them for this example might help (me, at least).
Also feel free to provide additional examples illustrating other points.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990930 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
Jason has updated the Vtable layout description in
<a href=abi-layout.html>abi-layout.html</a>
to reflect the approach from Cygnus and IBM.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[991014 all]</font>
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Do we promote base offsets out of base class vtables?
Answer: we promote them out of virtual bases,
but we do not promote them out of nonvirtual bases.
It's a time/space tradeoff.
The time saving is large for virtual bases,
but too small to bother with for nonvirtual bases.

<p>
<li>
Do we have rtti fields for classes that have virtual bases but no
virtual functions?
The C++ standard regards such classes as nonpolymorphic,
so performing rtti operations on them is undefined.
Decision: we will keep the rtti fields themselves in the vtable, in
the interest of having a uniform vtable format.  The slot of offset to
beginning of complete type will be filled in, and the slot for offset
to typeinfo object will contain 0.

<p>
<li>
When we discussed issue B-8, we agreed that we would have an
offset to typeinfo object rather than a pointer to typeinfo object.
This means that the typeinfo object is now part of the vtable.
It will go at the very beginning,
i.e. at a negative offset from where the vtpr points.
(Comment: We discussed B-6 before discussing B-8.
Does making this change interfere with having a uniform vtable offset,
since we won't have a typeinfo object at the beginning of a vtable
for a nonpolymorphic class with virtual bases?
Should we revisit decision (2) or (3), or am I just being paranoid?)
</ol>

<p>
ACTION ITEMS: Jason---update writeup to reflect these three changes.
Our decision on issue B-8 will require a one-sentence change.
All of us: study the revised version.
We are almost ready to close this issue,
and if we agree with the revised version we can close it at the
21 October meeting.

<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Note that putting GP in the Vtable prevents putting it in shared memory.
This interacts with B-4.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 HP -- Cary]</font>
For a C++ object to be placed into shared memory,
its vtable pointer must be valid in all processes
that are sharing that object.

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the vtable can be placed in text, that would be fine,
but the vtable contains function pointers (or descriptors)
that require runtime relocation, so it must be in data.

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in shared memory,
but only if the function pointers/descriptors are valid in all processes.
The entry point addresses, which refer to shared text, should be shareable,
but the gp values may not be identical for all processes.
(RTTI pointers are also an issue,
and could be solved by putting the RTTI information in shared memory as well.)

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in private memory,
provided they are at the same address in all processes.
</ol>

<p>
One way or another,
we need a way of ensuring that a pointer from shared 
memory to private memory is valid in all processes,
which means that we will need a means to ensure that certain shared
library data segments can get mapped at the same address in all
processes that load those certain libraries.

<p>
My wild idea a few years ago was to put the vtables in shared memory
(by allocating and building them at load time, as Taligent did),
and store a shared library index in place of the gp value
in each function descriptor.
Each process would have its own table of gp values,
indexed by this shared library index,
but the index space would be managed system-wide.
The C++ runtime library would have been responsible for allocating
a new index for each unique C++ shared library loaded on the system,
then storing the process-local copy of the gp pointer in the 
appropriate slot of the table.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990628 SGI -- Jim]</font>
Note a further problem with vtables in shared memory (Cary's point 2).
If a virtual function comes from another DSO,
it may be pre-empted differently in different programs.
Hence, the function pointer itself is a problem even if the GP isn't.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
An extensive discussion boiled down to a few points:
<ul>
<p>
<li> The primary issue is objects in shared memory --
    vtables aren't interesting in themselves, but rather because
    putting the object in shared memory implies having the vtable at
    the same address in all sharing processes.

<p>
<li> Many of us have a few customers asking for this.
    It is not clear just how extensive a facility they need,
    or how automatic it needs to be.
    We should attempt to gauge the need.

<p>
<li> Noone thinks we should penalize the non-shared case for
    the rare instances of shared demand.

<p>
<li> It is questionable whether we can define an ABI mechanism
    which will work on all of our systems,
    but we'd like not to preclude OS-specific extensions to do
    this if we can't.

<p>
<li> One possible approach would be an API allowing a user to
    place an object in shared memory,
    and then "install" it by setting its vtable pointers,
    possibly to copies also placed in the same shared memory.

<p>
<li> A more automatic approach would be something which allocated
    certain objects/vtables to shared memory,
    gave up at link time if not all pointers were internal to the
    object being linked,
    attempted to place the relevant segments at the same runtime
    addresses to allow sharing,
    and gave up on sharing if this was not possible.
    Such an approach would perhaps still require some care on the part
    of the user to prevent problematic runtime situations.
</ul>

<p>
These ideas are very fuzzy.
Participants should think about the need and possibilities and attempt
to identify more concrete approaches.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990805 All]</font>
It was determined (largely based on consideration by Jason)
that the only practical approach to putting objects in shared memory
is to force the objects, Vtables, functions, etc. to the same addresses
in the various processes involved.
If this is done, data representation issues are irrelevant.
Therefore, this issue is closed as moot.

<p>
Note that the base psABI defines a flag, EF_IA_64_ABSOLUTE,
which forces an executable object to the addresses specified in ELF,
so at least one method of representing this is already available.

This is closely related to issues A-6 and B-6.
It is agreed that what we need is an offset to the beginning of

We choose to have an offset to the typeinfo object instead of a pointer,
which effectively means that the typeinfo object is part of the vtable.
We will put it at the very beginning, at a negative offset from the vptr.

part of the vtable block, and to include an offset to RTTI information
in the vtable rather than a pointer to RTTI information.  (We decided
on this change so that we would have fewer symbols to resolve at link
time.)

<p>
Jim came up with a serious objection at the October 21 meeting:
during construction we need different RTTI information at different
points.  A few of us talked about this at Kona, and my impression is
that Jim's objection is fatal.  We could imagine having base class
typeinfo objects in every vtable block, but (1) this would kill any
performance advantage we'd get by using an offset rather than a
pointer; and (2) we'd lose the ability to use simple pointer identity
as a way of telling whether two typeinfos represent the same type.

<p>
I propose that we abandon that decision, and go back to using pointers.
Does everyone agree?

<p>
<font color=blue>[991028 All]</font>
Agreed.

Daveed and Matt will attempt to pin down the copy requirements with the
Core committee, i.e. when a non-trivial copy constructor may be elided.
The relevant Standard requirement is 12.8/15,
and there is an open defect report related to this question.
For cases where the ctor may not be elided,
we expect to perform the copy at the call site,
and pass a reference.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990729 All]</font>
Matt will produce a clear proposal for when the ABI will elide the
constructor (and therefore pass the class object like a normal C struct),
based on the Standard's exceptions.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990805 All]</font>
There are no cases where a non-trivial copy constructor can be simply
elided for all instances of a particular parameter.
Therefore, we shall use the consistent convention that,
if a value parameter's (class) type has a non-trivial copy constructor,
the caller will allocate space for it, perform the copy,
and pass a reference.

<p>
Note that the standard does allow the caller,
if the value being passed is a temporary,
to construct the temporary directly into the parameter memory
and elide the copy constructor call.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991028 all]</font>
For classes with virtual bases,
the Standard allows a synthesized copy assignment to copy the virtual
bases multiple times, but does not require it.
The simplest approach, recursively copying the base objects,
will cause multiple copies for virtual bases with multiple inheritance
paths.
This can be avoided by synthesizing a second copy assignment operator
which does not copy virtual bases, to be called when assigning a subobject.

<p>
The decision was made not to do so,
on grounds that the situation is rare,
and virtual bases are often empty besides,
so that the solution is not worth the resulting code bloat.

<b>Summary</b>:
The IA64 exceptions handling framework is largely language independent.
What is the behaviour of a C++ runtime receiving, for instance,
an exception thrown from Java?
Does it call terminate()?
Does it allow the exception to pass through C++ code with destructors
if there is no catch clause?
Does it allow the exception to be caught in a catch(...) provided this
catch(...) ends with a rethrow?
Does it allow even more?
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Resolution</b>:
In general, foreign exceptions will cause normal destructor invocation
and other cleanup in C++ code, and will pass through C++ frames except
where explicit exception specifications do not allow them.
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Jim]</font>
We propose that this be resolved by identifying the source language in
the exception descriptor and specifying that the personality routine be
able to perform cleanup actions during handling of foreign-language
exceptions, but not attempt to catch them.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991006 All]</font>
The concensus of the group,
from the discussion of the low-level exception API, is:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
A foreign-language exception,
passing through a C++ frame,
will cause normal destructor invocations exactly as a C++ exception would.
<p>
<li>
Since catch(...) is commonly used as a cleanup mechanism (with a rethrow)
rather than as a true catch,
it is appropriate to catch and rethrow even foreign-language exceptions.
<p>
<li>
Function exception specifications present a more complex issue.
A foreign exception will generally not match any of the specified
allowed exceptions
(though implementations might deal with special cases).
For consistency, it is expected that a foreign exception will be
caught by a throw specification and not passed through,
i.e. that unexpected() will be called.

</ul>

<p>
<font color=blue>[991007 All]</font>
In addition to the above,
Christophe will define an exception __foreign_exception to be used
by foreign-language code which wants to raise an exception that C++ can
catch.
<p>
Close this issue.

<b>Summary</b>:
The exception handling framework requires the interaction of the
runtime of all the languages "on the stack" during exception processing.
Some of these languages may have very different exception handling semantics.
What are the constraints we impose on the C++ exception handling runtime
to preserve the relative language neutrality of the EH framework?
Example: do we allow a handler to cleanup and resume at the point
where the exception was thrown?
</td> </tr>
<b>Resolution</b>:
Moot -- resume-type exceptions are more appropriately handled by
registering trap handlers and processing them in place.
No interaction with stack traceback should be necessary.
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Jim]</font>
The typical case of cleanup and resume is floating point trap handling,
which is normally handled entirely in the original FP trap handler.
Is there an example where stack walkback must occur to identify the
handler, but resumption at the point-of-exception is required?
I can't think of any, and I think the model of registering a trap
handler is preferable for such purposes.

I'd like to see an indirection in vararg lists,
so they can be passed through thunks.
This is necessary at least for the covariant returns,
but might have other applications as well.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990810 HU-B Martin]</font>
Since there already was the decision not to return a list of
pointers from a covariant method,
the only alternative to real thunks
is code duplication (as done in Sun Workshop 5).
<i>(Or alternate entrypoints...  Jim)</i>

<p>
With real thunks, you have to copy the argument list.
That is not possible for a varargs list,
so here is my proposal for varargs in C++:

<p>
In the place of the ellipsis, a pointer to the first argument is passed.
In case of a thunk for covariant returns,
this pointer can be copied to the destination function.
The variable arguments are put on the stack as they normally would.

<p>
With that, the issue is in which cases to use such a calling
convention:
<ol>
<li> only for vararg calls to virtual methods, or
<li> only for vararg calls to functions with C++ linkage, or
<li> for all vararg calls.
     That would probably require a change to the C ABI
</ol>
<p>
Option (1) could be further restricted to methods returning a pointer
or reference to class type. 

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 All]</font>
In response to a question,
it was observed that passing one variant of a class hierarchy in a
varargs list and referencing another variant in the va_arg macro is undefined,
and we don't need to worry about a mechanism for doing the conversion.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991014 All]</font>
We would want to reject option (3),
even if it were still possible to change the base ABI.
The present scheme is compatible with K&R C methods,
the proposed change would not be.

<p>
Decision: Close with no action.
We're using multiple entry points for covariant return types, not thunks,
so there's no need for doing anything different for varargs functions
with covariant return types than for any other varargs functions.
