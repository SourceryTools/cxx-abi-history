<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>RTTI Implementation in ABI2</H1>

<p>The typeinfo object is implemented as:
<PRE>
    class type_info {
	// public interface ignored
    private:
	static_type_info* static_data;
    };
</PRE

<P>The static_type_info objects are shared with the exception implementation.
The static data has the following format.  In this description we
make heavy use of self-relative pointers for position independence.
We denote self-relative pointers by "$" instead of "*".  They are
represented in the structures as lvalues of type ptr_diff_t.
For example, we might have a field:
<PRE>
    base_block$ bases;	// base information.
</PRE>
<P>These are converted to real pointers using the following template.
<PRE>
    template <class T> to_real_ptr(ptr_diff_t& p)
    {
	return (T)((char*)p + *p);
    }
</PRE>
<P>Thus a self-relative pointer to a "base_block" is accessed by
<PRE>
    *to_rel_ptr<base_block*>(ti->bases);

    struct static_type_info {
	const char$ ty_name;		// print name for the type
	ptr_diff_t reserved;   		// Can be filled as described below
	class_base_descr$ base_table;	// base class information for cast
	uint32 type_hash[4];		// unique identifier
	uint32 flags;			// notes on the type
	uint32 cv_qualifiers;		// const-vol qualifiers
	uint32 pointer_count() const;	// pointer level count;
	uint32 voidstar_flag() const;	// non-zero if void*
	uint32 dotdotdot_flag() const;	// non-zero if "..." 

    };

    struct class_base_descr {
	uint32 type_hash[4];		// unique identifier
	size_t offset;			// offset in most-derived
    };
</PRE>
<DL>
<DT>ty_name:	<DD>Pointer to a null-terminated name for the type.
		In general this name should be a utf8 value

<DT>reserved:	<DD>A tool for extending the typeinfo object in an
		orthogonal direction. For example, this could be a
		self-relative pointer to a Java data block.  For C++ types,
		extension should probably be by derivation.

<DT>base_table:	<DD>For all classes this is a self-relative pointer to an array
		of class_base_descr entries.  Each entry contains the
		hash for that class and the offset of that class within
		the most derived class.  The most significant two bits
		of the offset are used as flags. The msb is set to 
		indicate the last entry in the array, and the next
		msb is set to indicate that the path from most derived
		to the entry is private.  The entries are in depth-first
		left-to-right order based on the inheritance dag, except
		that each subobject is represented exactly once.  The 
		most derived class is the last entry.  Its offset entry 
		will always have only the sign bit set, since it has a
		zero offset, and is never private or ambiguous.
		Pointers to classes will share the same base_table as
		the class itself.

<DT>type_hash:	<DD>A hash function representing the type.  This is
		obtained by applying the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
		to the mangled name for the representative type.  The
		representative type is chosen to make exception type
		matching easy, and is determined as follows:
		<UL>
		<LI>For pointers to class, the class.
		<LI>For all other pointers to objects, the pointer with
		    cv-qualification removed at all levels.
		<LI>For other types, the type itself
		<LI>For "..." the mangled name is the empty string
		</UL>

<DT>flags:	<DD>This contains bitflags used to describe a type.  If
		the type is not a pointer to an object, this word contains
		zero.  There are two flag values.
		<UL>
		    <TABLE>
		    <TR><TD>void*			<TD>0x80000000
		    <TR><TD>any type (...)		<TD>0x40000000
		    </TABLE>
		</UL>
		the value is 
		    <number of pointer levels> + flags.

		There are no references, as they are irrelevent in
		all contexts in which these objects are used.

<DT>cv_qualifiers:  <DD>A bitmask representing the cv qualifications for any
		pointer levels.  The number of pointer levels is part
		of the pointer_flags field.  Two bits are used for each
		level of pointers. 0x2 implies that the level points to
		constant, while 0x1 implies that it points to volatile.
		These bits are built up with the outermost pointer to
		the left, and the entire set is right justified.  For
		example 
		<UL>
		<TABLE>
			<TR><TD>const char*		<TD>-> 0x2<TD>(10)
			<TR><TD>const char**		<TD>-> 0x8<TD>(1000)
			<TR><TD>const char*const*	<TD>-> 0xA<TD>(1010)
			<TR><TD>const char*volatile*	<TD>-> 0x9<TD>(1001)
		</TABLE>
		</UL>
		This can only represent 16 levels of pointer, but IR
		can only represent 13, so this works.  If desired,
		with a more reasonable IR, we can extend this field
		by replacing it with a self-relative pointer to multiple
		words.  This would be triggered by the pointer_levels
		value in "flags".  It is not currently used.  

<DT>pointer_count() const:	<DD> The pointer level count.
		This returns the lower 16 bits of the flags

<DT>voidstar_flag() const:	<DD> Nonzero if thisis void*.  This just
		masks off the flag, it doesn't convert it to bool.

<DT>dotdotdot_flag() const;	<DD> non-zero if this is "...".  This just
		masks off the flag, it doesn't convert it to bool.
</DL>

<H3>Issues with RTTI blocks still open to change.</H3>

<P>Polymorphic classes have references to static_type_info blocks in their
virtual tables.  Virtual table entries are of type
<PRE>
    union vtab_entry { 
	void (*f)();	// function pointer
	ptr_diff_t o;	// offset adjustment
    };
</PRE>
If the virtual pointer in a class is denoted by "virt_ptr", then
<PRE>
    virt_ptr[0].o
</PRE>
is a self-relative pointer to static type data for the most-derived class,
and
<PRE>
    virt_ptr[1].o
</PRE>
is the offset of the subobject with the virtual pointer in the entire
class object.

<H3>Dynamic Casts</H3>

<P>Dynamic casts are divided into cases at compile time, and each case
generates different code.

<DL>
<DT><P><B>Up cast to a base class:</B>

<DD><P>Handled as a normal static cast.  No dynamic code is generated

<DT><P><B>Cast to void*</B>

<DD><P>This is defined as returning a pointer to the start of the entire
    object.  Code is generated inline.
<UL>
<PRE>
static_type* temp;
(temp = opnd,
(temp != NULL)
    ? (void*)(((char*)temp) - temp->virtualsym[1].o)
    : (void*) temp
) 
</PRE>
</UL>
<DT><P><B>Source class is a unique non-virtual base class of destination class</B>

<DD> This generates a call to the function
<PRE>
<UL>
void* __Crun::simple_down_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// original pointer
	    static_type_info* sclass,	// source class
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class
</UL>
</PRE>
    In this case there can be only one subobject of the static source
    type, and the only piece of information needed is the offset within
    the entire object, which the routine picks up from the virtual table.

<P>    The algorithm is:
<OL>
<LI>	If the opnd is NULL, return NULL.

<LI>	Search the base class table looking for an entry with the proper
	static class at the offset of the static class.

<LI>	Search the base table from that point looking for a match
	with the destination class
	
<LI>	If the destination class is not found the cast fails, return NULL

<LI>	Otherwise, the cast succeeds, since other conditions have
	been checked statically.  Adjust the pointer using the two
	offsets. and return it.
</OL>
<DT><P><B>Source is a public base class of dest, but there is some virtual
    inheritance involved so that there could be more than one class
    derived from this subobject.</B>

<DD> This generates a call to the function
<UL>
<PRE>
void* __Crun::down_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// Original pointer
	    static_type_info* sclass,	// source class
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class
</PRE>
</UL>
    In this case the dynamic table is searched to find subobjects of type
    "sclass" at the offset obtained from the virtual table.  Then the
    cast to "dclass" proceeds from that object.

<P>The algorithm is:
<OL>
<LI>	If the opnd is NULL, return NULL.

<LI>	Search the base table from first to last, looking for a match
	with the source class that has the same offset as the original
	subobject.

<LI>	If this search fails, we have an internal error.

<LI>	If the "private" bit is set in this base entry, the cast fails,
	return NULL

<LI>	From that point, search the base table toward the last, looking
	for a match with the destination class.
	
<LI>	If the destination class is not found, or if the "private" bit
	is set, the cast fails, return NULL

<LI>	Continue searching for the destination class.  If it is found,
	the cast fails, return NULL

<LI>	Otherwise, the cast succeeds, and the pointer is adjusted using
	the offset from the vtable and the offset of the destination
	class entry.
</OL>

<DT><P><B>There is no relationship between the types, so the cast must cross the
    hierarchy in the most-derived class</B>
<DD>
<UL>
<PRE>
void* __Crun::cross_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// original pointer
	    static_type_info* sclass,	// source class
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>    The algorithm is:
<oL>
<LI>	If the opnd is NULL, return NULL.

<LI>	Search the base table from first to last, looking for a match
	with the source class that has the same offset as the original
	subobject.

<LI>	If this search fails, we have an internal error.

<LI>	If the "private" bit is set in this base entry, the cast fails,
	return NULL

<LI>	Beginning again from the start, search the base table toward
	the last, looking for a match with the destination class.
	
<LI>	If the destination class is not found, or if the "private" bit
	is set, the cast fails, return NULL

<LI>	Continue searching for the destination class.  If it is found,
	the cast fails, return NULL

<LI>	Otherwise, the cast succeeds, and the pointer is adjusted using
	the offset from the vtable and the offset of the destination
	class entry.
</OL>
</DL>
<P>The reference casts are identical, except that they throw an exception
instead of returning NULL.  The corresponding functions are:
<UL>
<PRE>
void* __Crun::ref_simple_down_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// original pointer
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class

void* __Crun::ref_down_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// Original pointer
	    static_type_info* sclass,	// source class
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class

void* __Crun::ref_cross_cast(
	    void* opnd,			// original pointer
	    static_type_info* sclass,	// source class
	    static_type_info* dclass);	// destination class
</PRE>
</UL>
<H3>Typeid</H3>

<P>Objects of type "type_info" are required to be polymorphic, which means
that they have vtable pointers, and these pointers are not self-relative
or position-independent.  The practical consequence of this is that 
type_info objects cannot be allocated in readonly memory.  They could
be statically allocated, but this has the disadvantage that they then
go into global data, expanding that area and forcing the program toward
big PIC code, with attendent overheads.

<P>Since the use of type_info objects is probably going to be rare, and
in many cases will be associated with expensive operations like IO,
it seems better to allocate them dynamically as needed.
<PRE>
    class type_info {
    public:
	// Operators ignored

    private:
	const static_type_info* data;
    };
</PRE>
Type_info objects then will consist of two pointers, on to the virtual
table and one to the corresponding static_type_info object generated
by the compiler. There is no need for the objects to be unique, as all
comparisons are done on the type hash and pointer data.  It would probably
be well to allocate space in groups, and to use a small hash table based
on the address of the static information to keep allocation down.

<P>"typeid" can be applied either statically or dynamically.
<OL>
<LI>  Dynamic determination, must be a polymorphic class

    <P>Calls the function
<PRE>
	const type_info& __Crun::get_typeid(
		    void* opnd);		// The object pointer
</PRE>
    This function extracts the static_type_info from the virtual table
    and creates a type_info object.  If "opnd" is void it throws an
    exception.

<LI>  Static determination, could be any type

    <P>Calls the function
<PRE>
	const type_info& __Crun::make_typeid(
		    static_type_info* data);	// static data
</PRE>
    This function creates a type_info object with the supplied static data.
</OL>
<H3>Exception Interface</H3>
The exception matching and casting rules are not the same as dynamic cast,
so we need an interface to provide RTTI services for exceptions.
<DL>
<DT>
<pre>
bool __Cimpl::exception_matches(
		const __Crun::static_type_info* src,
		const __Crun::static_type_info* dest);
</pre>
<DD>True if the catch type represented by "dest" is a valid match for the
static exception type, represented by "src".
<DT>
<pre>
void* __Cimpl::exception_adjust(
		const __Crun::static_type_info* src,
		const __Crun::static_type_info* dest,
		void* obj);
</pre>
<DD>Assuming that we have found an exception match, make any necessary
offset adjustment required to cast from the source type to the
destination type.  This always casts up the hierarchy, doing the
equivalent of a static_cast.  Note when using this that if the
thrown type is a pointer this adjustment should be applied to the
thrown value itself, rather than to the pointer to the thrown object.
<DT>
<PRE>
bool __Cimpl::is_bad_exception(const __Crun::static_type_info* src);
</pre>
<DD> True if the argument is the static type info object for the
"bad_exception" type.  This is needed while handling unexpected() calls
</DL>

<H3>Generation Strategy</H3>

<P>Static type info blocks have a name formed by appending the mangled
name for the represented type to "__RTTI__".  The namespace in which
the blocks are placed will depend on where the block is generated,
not on the type represented.

<P>There are three algorithms for determining the location of static
information blocks.
<OL>
<LI>For a polymorphic class with a non-inline, non-pure virtual function,
    the virtual table and static type data for that class are generated
    as global definitions in the compilation unit containing the definition
    of that function.  The static type data will be generated in the
    innermost namespace enclosing the class.
    In the same compilation unit we will generate
    the static data for a pointer to the class and a pointer to const
    class.  These will share a single base class table, which is
    considered a static member of the class and will also be generated there.
    That is, for "class ns::foo", we will generate
<UL>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>	ns::foo::_vtbl		<TD>The virtual table
<TR><TD>	ns::foo::__BASE_TABLE__	<TD>The base table for foo
<TR><TD>	ns::__RTTI__&lt;foo>	<TD>foo static data
<TR><TD>	ns::__RTTI__&lt;foo>	<TD>foo* static data
<TR><TD>	ns::__RTTI__&lt;const foo*>	<TD>const foo* static data
</TABLE>
</UL>
<LI>  For builtin and very common types the static data will be generated in
    the support library.  These will be generated in namespace "__Crun".
    Generation of library type_info data can be enabled with the pragma:
<PRE>
	#pragma generate_library(static_type_info)
</PRE>
    A tentative list of library type data is:
<UL>
<LI>	All builtin types
<LI>	void*
<LI>	char*
<LI>	const char*
<LI>	wchar_t*
<LI>	const wchar_t*
</UL>
   <P> NOTE:  This is not yet implemented.  Currently, these types are handled
    as in case 3.

<LI>For all other types, static type information is generated as a weak
    global variable in any compilation unit in which it is needed.
    Such blocks are generated in file_scope.  The
    symbol is made a weak global rather than a static to simplify
    generation of unique type_info objects.
</OL>
<H3>Debugger interface</H3>
<P>When compiled with debugging enabled, each generated RTTI
block will have a corresponding RTTI stab to map the type onto the symbol
name.  The following functions provide a relatively simple interface
to the rtti functionality

<DL>
<DT>
<PRE>
extern "C" const type_info* __exdbg_get_typeinfo(
			const static_type_info*); </PRE>
<DD>
Obtains a pointer to a type_info object corresponding to the pointer to
a static_type_info object.  There is no guarantee that there is only
one type_info object per type.
<DT>
<PRE>
extern "C" void* __exdbg_dynamic_cast(
			void* obj,
			const static_type_info* source,
			const static_type_info* dest); </PRE>
<DD>
Given a pointer to a polymorphic object, apply a dynamic cast to that
object.  "source" is the static_type_info for the static type of the
object and "dest" is the static_type_info for the desired type.  The
result will be an appropriately adjusted pointer if the cast succeeds
or NULL if the cast fails.  A NULL pointer will also return NULL rather
than throwing an exception
