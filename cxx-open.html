<p>
<font color=blue>[990616]</font>
Added HP summaries.
Added sketchy notes from 990610 discussions (A and B issues).
A-10 was intended by HP as something different than I described,
so it was renamed, and a new issue A-13 opened as an SGI issue.
HP did not submit A-12, so relabeled as Sun's (is that right?).
Added library interface issues, H-1 and H-2.

<h3> Definitions </h3>

<p>
The issues below make use of the following definitions:

<dl>

<p>
<dt> <i>empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class with no non-static data members,
no virtual functions, no virtual base classes,
and no non-empty non-virtual base classes.)

<p>
<dt> <i>nearly empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class, the objects of which contain only a Vptr.

<p>
<dt> <i>vague linkage</i> </dt>
<dd>
The treatment of entities --
e.g. inline functions, templates, vtables --
with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.

</dl>

It will be shared with the first polymorphic non-virtual base class,

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
HP noted that Taligent chooses a base class with virtual bases before
one without as the primary base class),
probably to avoid additional "this" pointer adjustments.
SGI observed that such a rule would prevent users from controlling the
choice by their ordering of the base classes in the declaration.
The bias of the group remains the above resolution,
but HP will attempt to find the Taligent rationale before this is decided.

a slightly unusual approach such as using secondary entry points

<b>Summary</b>:
There are several methods for adjusting the 'this' pointer of the
returned value for member functions with covariant return types.
We need to decide how this is done.
Return thunks might be especially costly on IA64,
so a solution based on returning multiple pointers may prove more interesting.

<font color=blue>[990610 Matt]</font>
One possibility is to have two Vtable entries,
which might point to different functions, different entrypoints,
or a real entrypoint and a thunk.
Another is to return two result pointers (base/derived),
and have the caller select the right one.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Daveed presented his multiple-return-value scheme,
including an example that involved virtual base classes,
return values that are pointers to nonpolymorphic classes,
and other equally horrible things.

<p>
Consensus: we need to get the horrible cases correct,
but speed only matters in the simple case.
The simple case: class B has a virtual function f returning a B1*
and class D has a virtual function f returning a D1*,
where all four classes are polymorphic,
B is a primary base of D, and B1 is a primary base of D1.
(The really important case is where B1 is B and D1 is D,
but that simplification doesn't make any difference.)

<p>
Jason: Would the usual multiple-entry-point scheme work just as well?
That is, would it be just as fast as Daveed's scheme in the simple case,
and still preserve enough information for the more complicated cases?
It appears so, but we don't have a proof.
Jason will try to provide one.


<p>
<font color=blue>[990716 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
Proof?
You always know what types a given override must be able to return,
and you know how to convert from the return type to those base types.
You know from the entry point which type is desired.
Seems pretty straightforward to me.



<p>
<font color=blue>[990716 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
The alternative I was talking about yesterday goes something like this:

<p>
When we have a non-trivial covariant return situation,
we create a new entry in the vtable for the new return type.
The caller chooses which vtable entry to use based on the type they want.

<p>
This could be implemented several ways,
at the discretion of the vendor:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
Multiple entry points to one function,
with an internal flag indicating which type to return.
<p>
<li>
Thunks which intercept the function's return and modify the return value.
Note that unlike the case of calling virtual functions,
for covariant returns we always know which adjustments will be needed,
so we don't have to pay for a long branch.
We do, however, lose the 1-1 correspondence between calls and returns,
which apparently affects performance on the Pentium Pro.
<p>
<li>
Function duplication.
</ol>

<p>
The advantage of this approach to the complex case is that we don't have to
do a dynamic_cast when faced with multiple levels of virtual derivation.
It is also strictly simpler;
Daveed's model already requires something like
this in cases of multiple inheritance.

<p>
Of course, we can always mix and match;
we could choose to only do this in cases of virtual inheritance,
or use Daveed's proposal and do this only in
cases of repeated virtual inheritance.
In that case, the multiple returns
would just be an optimization for the single virtual inheritance case.

<p>
Since we don't seem to care about the performance of
anything but single nonvirtual inheritance,
it seems simpler not to bother with multiple returns.

<p>
The remaining question is how to handle the case of nontrivial
nonvirtual inheritance:
do we use multiple slots or have the caller do the adjustment?
My inclination is to have the caller adjust.

<p>
WRT patents,
the idea of having the function return the base-most class and having
the caller adjust is parallel to the patented Microsoft scheme whereby
they pass the base-most class as the 'this' argument to virtual functions,
but the word 'return' does not appear anywhere in the patent,
so it seems safe.

<b>Summary</b>:
The contents of the vtable can sometimes be modified,
but the concensus is that it is nonetheless always allowed to "cache" elements,
i.e. to retain them in registers and reuse them,
whenever it is really useful.
However, this may sometimes break "beyond the standard" code,
such as code loading a shared library that replaces a virtual function.
Can we all agree when caching is allowed?

<b>Summary</b>:
In C++, there are various things with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.
From the user's standpoint, this applies to inlines and templates.
From the implementation's perspective,
it also applies to things like vtables and RTTI info.
(We call this <i>vague linkage</i>.)
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
There are several ways of dealing with vague linkage items:
<ol>
<li> Emit them everywhere and only use one.
<li> Use some heuristic to decide where to emit them.
<li> Use a database to decide where to emit them.
<li> Generate them at link time.
</ol>

<p>
#3 and #4 are feasible for templates,
but I consider them too heavyweight to be used for other things.

<p>
The typical heuristic for #2 is "with the first non-inline,
non-abstract virtual function in the class".
This works pretty well,
but fails for classes that have no such virtual function,
and for non-member inlines.
Worse, the heuristic may produce different results in different
translation units,
as a method could be defined inline after being declared non-inline
in the class body.
So we have to handle multiple copies in some cases anyway.

<p>
The way to handle this in standard ELF is weak symbols.
If all definitions are marked weak,
the linker will choose one
and the others will just sit there taking up space.

<p>
Christophe mentioned the other day that the HP compiler used the
typical heuristic above,
and handled the case of different results by encoding the
key function in the vtable name.
But this seems unnecessary when we can just choose one of multiple defns.

<p>
A better solution than weak symbols alone would be to set things up so
that the linker will discard the extra copies.
Various existing implementations of this are:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
The Microsoft PE/COFF defn includes support for COMDAT sections,
which key off of the first symbol defined.
One copy is chosen, others are discarded.
You can specify conditions to the linker
(must have same contents, must have same size).

<p>
<li>
The IBM XCOFF platform includes a garbage-collecting linker;
sections that are not referenced in a sweep from main are discarded.
In xlC, template instantiations are emitted in separate sections,
with encoded names;
at link time, one copy is renamed to the real mangled name,
and the others are discarded by garbage collection.
</ol>

<p>
The GNU ELF toolchain does a variant of #1 here;
any sections with names beginning with ".gnu.linkonce."
are treated as COMDAT sections.
It seems more sensible to me to key off of the section name
than the first symbol name as in PE.

<p>
The GNU linker recently added support for garbage collection,
and I've been thinking about changing our handling of vague
linkage to make use of it, but haven't.

<p>
I propose that the ia64 base ABI be extended to
provide for either COMDAT sections or garbage collection,
and that we use that support for vague linkage.

<p>
I further propose that we not use heuristics to
cut down the number of copies ahead of time;
they usually work fine, but can cause problems in some situations,
such as when not all of the class's members are in the same symbol space.
Does the ia64 ABI provide for controlling which symbols
are exported from a shared library?

<p>
A side issue: What do we want to do with
dynamically-initialized variables?
The same thing, or use COMMON?
I propose COMMON.

<p>
See also G-3, for vague linkage of inlined routines and their static variables.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 SGI summarizing others]</font>
HP uses COMDAT for many cases, keying from the symbol names.
HP also uses some heuristics.
HP observes that IA-64 objects will already be large.
From the base ABI discussions,
any use of WEAK or COMMON symbols will need to take care not to depend
on vendor-specific treatment.

<p>
Defining a COMDAT mechanism doesn't preclude using heuristics to avoid
some copies up front.
A COMDAT mechanism should also specify how to get rid of associated
sections like debugging info, unless the identical mechanism works.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990629 HP -- Christophe]</font>
First, the "usual" heuristic
(which is usual because it dates back to Cfront)
is to emit vtables in the translation unit that contains  
the definition of the first non inline, non pure virtual function.  
That is, for:
<pre><code>
        struct X {
                void a();
                virtual void f() { return; }
                virtual void g() = 0;
                virtual void h();
                virtual void i();
        };
</code></pre>
the vtable is emitted only in the TU that contains the definition of h().

<p>
This breaks and becomes non-portable if:
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing. In that case,
    you generally emit duplicate versions of vtables
<li>There is a "change of mind",
    such as having the above class followed by:
    <code><p>
    <dd>inline void X::h() { f(); }
    </code>
</ul>

<p>
Now, the COMDAT issue is as follows:
a COMDAT section is, in some cases, slightly more difficult to handle
(at least, that's the impression Jason gave me).
For statics with runtime initialization,  
what you can do is reserve COMMON space ('easier'),
then initialize that space at runtime.
As I said, the problem is if two compilers disagree on whether this
is a runtime or a compile time initialization, such as in :
<pre><code>
	int f() { return 1; }
	int x = f();	// Static (COMDAT) or Dynamic (COMMON) initialization?
</code></pre>

<p>
So I personally recommend that we put everything in COMDAT.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Consensus so far: use a heuristic for vtable and typeinfo emission,
based on the definition of the key function.
(The first virtual function that is not
declared inline in the class definition.)
The vtable must be emitted where the key function is defined,
it may also be emitted in other translation units as well.
If there is no key function then the vtable must be emitted in any
translation unit that refers to the vtable in any way.

<p>
Implication: the linker must be prepared to discard duplicate vtables.
We want to use COMDAT sections for this
(and for other entities with vague linkage.)

<p>
Open issue: the elf format allows only 16 bits for section identifiers,
and typically two of those bits are already taken up for other things.
So we've only got 16k sections available,
which is unacceptable if we're creating lots of small sections.

<p>
Jason - COMDATs disappear into text and data at link time,
so the issue is really only serious if we've got more than 16k vtables
(or template instantiations, etc.)
in a single translation unit.

<p>
Daveed - HP has gotten around this problem by hacking their ELF files
to steal another 8 bits from somewhere else.

<p>
Jack - a new kind of section table could be a viable solution.
However, it would break everything if we did it for ia32.
Is a solution that only works on ia64 acceptable?
Note also that the elf section table has its own string table,
which we wouldn't be able to share with the new kind of section table.
Index and link fields often point into section table,
we would have to figure out how to deal with this.
(Jack is not opposed to the idea of an alternate section table,
he is just pointing out some of the issues we will have to resolve.)

<font color=blue>[990630 HP - Christophe]</font>

<p>
Here is a short description of the virtual tables layout. This is
mostly taken out of the existing Taligent runtime.


<p>
<h4>Virtual tables</h4>

<p>
Virtual tables (vtables) are used to dispatch virtual functions, to  
access virtual base class subobjects, and to access information for  
runtime type identification (RTTI). Each class that has virtual
member functions or virtual bases has an associated set of vtables.  
The vtable pointers within all the objects (instances) of a class
point to the same set of vtables.


<p>
<h4>Vtable layout</h4>

<p>
Each vtable consists of the following parts, in the order listed.
All offsets in a vtable are of type ptrdiff_t.

<p>
"Virtual base offsets" are used to access the virtual bases of an
object and to non virtual bases when pointer adjustment is required  
for some overriden virtual function. Each entry is a displacement to  
a virtual base subobject from the location within the object of the  
vtable pointer that addresses this vtable. These entries are only
necessary if the class directly or indirectly inherits from virtual  
base classes, or if it overrides a virtual function defined in a base  
class and if  adjustment from the based to the derived class is
needed. The values can be positive or negative.

<p>
"Offset to top" holds the displacement to the top of the object from  
the location within the object of the vtable pointer that addresses  
this vtable. A negative value indicates the vtable pointer is part of  
an embedded base class subobject; otherwise it is zero. The offset
provides a way to find the top of the object from any base subobject  
with a vtable
pointer. This is necessary for dynamic_cast<void*> in particular.
The virtual pointer points to the "offset to top" field.

<p>
"Typeinfo pointer" points to the typeinfo object used for RTTI. All  
entries in each of the vtables for a given class point to the same
typeinfo object.

<p>
"Duplicate base information pointer" points to a table used to
perform runtime disambiguation of duplicate base classes for dynamic  
casts. The entries in each of the vtables for a given class do not
all point to the same table of duplicate base information.

<p>
Function pointers are used for virtual function dispatch. Each
pointer holds either the address of a virtual function of the class,  
or the address of a secondary entry point that performs certain
adjustments before transferring control to a virtual function. [To be  
discussed] In the case of shared library builds, [Solution 1] a
function pointer entry contains the address of a function descriptor,  
which contains the target GP value and the actual function address
[Solution 2] a function pointer entry contains two words: the value  
of the target GP value and the actual function address [Solution 3] a  
function pointer points to an import table generated by the dynamic  
loader, which will transfer control to the target function.

<p>
The function pointers are grouped so that the entries for all
virtual functions introduced by a base class are kept together, in
declaration order. Function pointers from a derived class immediately  
follow those for the base class. The order of function pointers
therefore depends on the static type of subobject whose vtable
pointer points to that virtual table.

<p>
A vtable pointer in an object addresses the "offset to top" field
of a vtable. This location is known as the address point of the
vtable. Note that the virtual base offsets are at negative
displacements from the address point.

<p>
The typeinfo and duplicate base information are covered in separate  
discussions.



<p>
<h4>Types of vtables</h4>

<p>
The following categories describe the rules for how vtables of a
class are constructed from the vtables of its bases.

<p>
<b>Category 1</b>

<p>
This category is for a class that inherits no base classes. If the
class declares no virtual functions, then it has no vtable, and its  
objects have no vtable pointers.

If the class declares virtual functions, then it has a single vtable  
containing RTTI fields followed by function pointer entries. There  
is one function pointer entry for each virtual function declared in  
the class. The vtable pointer in an object of the class addresses
this vtable.

<p>
<b>Category 2</b>

<p>
This category is for a class that inherits only non-virtual base
classes, and the non- virtual base classes have no base classes, and  
there is no adjustment in any of the overriden virtual functions.

<p>
If none of the base classes have vtables, a vtable is constructed
for the class according to the same rules as in Category 1. Otherwise  
the class has a vtable for each base class that has a vtable. The
class's vtables are constructed from copies of the base class
vtables. The entries are the same, except:
<ul>
<li>The RTTI fields contain information for the class, rather than
for the base class.
<p>
<li>The function pointer entries for virtual functions inherited from  
the base class and
overridden by this class are replaced with the addresses of the
overridden functions
(or the corresponding adjustor secondary entry points),
<p>
<li>At negative offsets, offsets to the base classes are generated if  
used by adjustor secondary entry points.
</ul>

<p>
Informally, each of these vtables has a name in the form
Base-in-Derived vtable, where Base is a base class and Derived is the  
derived class. Each vtable pointer in an object addresses one of
these vtables for the class. The vtable pointer of an A subobject
within a B object would address the A-in-B vtable.

<p>
The vtable copied from the primary base class is also called the
primary vtable; it is addressed by the vtable pointer at the top of  
the object. The other vtables of the class are called secondary
vtables; they are addressed by vtable pointers inside the object.


<p>
Aside from the function pointer entries that correspond to those of  
the primary base class, the primary vtable holds the following
additional entries at its tail:
- Entries for virtual functions introduced by this class
- Entries for overridden virtual functions not already in the
vtable. (These are also called replicated entries because they are
already in the secondary vtables of the class.) [I wonder if this is  
actually needed, this seems to be a consequence of RRBC]

<p>
The primary vtable, therefore, has the base class functions
appearing before the derived
class functions. The primary vtable can be viewed as two vtables
accessed from a shared
vtable pointer.


<p>
Note Another benefit of replicating virtual function entries is
that it reduces the number of this pointer adjustments during virtual  
calls. Without replication, there would be more cases where the this  
pointer would have to be adjusted to access a secondary vtable prior  
to the call. These additional cases would be exactly those where the  
function is overridden in the derived class, implying an additional  
thunk adjustment back to the original pointer. Thus replication saves  
two adjustments for each virtual call to an overridden function
introduced by a non-primary base class.


<p>
<b>Category 3</b>

<p>
This category is for a class that inherits only virtual base
classes, and the virtual base classes have no base classes.

<p>
The class has a vtable for each virtual base class that has a
vtable. These are all secondary vtables and are constructed from
copies of the base class vtables according to the same rules as in
Category 2. The vtable pointers of the virtual base subobjects within  
the object address these vtables.

<p>
The class also has a vtable that is not copied from the virtual base  
class vtables. This vtable is the primary vtable of the class and
addressed by the vtable pointer at the top of the object, which is
not shared. It holds the following function pointer entries:
<ul>
<li>
Entries for virtual functions introduced by this class
<li>
Entries for overridden virtual functions. (These are also called
replicated entries, because they are already in the secondary vtables  
of the class)
</ul>

<p>
The primary vtable also has virtual base offset entries to allow
finding the virtual base subobjects. There is one virtual base
offset entry for each virtual base class. For a class that inherits  
only virtual bases, the entries are in the reverse order in which the  
virtual bases appear in the class declaration, that is, the entry
for the leftmost virtual base is
closest to the address point of the vtable.


<p>
<b>Category 4</b>

<p>
This category is for a class that directly or indirectly inherits
base classes that are either virtual or non-virtual.

<p>
The rules for constructing vtables of the class are a combination of  
the rules from Categories 2 and 3, and for the most part can be
determined inductively. However the rules for placing virtual base
offset entries in the vtables requires elaboration.

<p>
The primary vtable has virtual base offset entries for all virtual
bases directly or indirectly inherited by the class. Each secondary  
vtable has entries only for virtual bases visible to the
corresponding base class. The entries in the primary vtable are
ordered so that entries for virtual bases visible to the primary base  
class appear below entries for virtual bases only visible to this
class.

<p>
For virtual bases only visible to this class, the entries are in the  
reverse order in which the virtual bases are encountered in a
depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the inheritance graph formed  
by the class definitions. Note
that this does not follow the order that virtual bases are placed in  
the object.



<p>
<h4>Vtables for partially constructed objects</h4>

<p>
In some situations, a special vtable, called a construction vtable
is used during the execution of base class constructors and
destructors. These vtables are for specific cases of virtual
inheritance.

<p>
During the construction of a class object, the object assumes the
type of each of its base classes, as each base class subobject is
constructed. RTTI queries in the base class constructor will return  
the type of the base class, and virtual calls will resolve to member  
functions of the base class rather than the complete class. Normally,  
this behavior is accomplished by setting, in the base class
constructor, the object's vtable pointers to the addresses of the
vtables for the base class.

<p>
However, if the base class has direct or indirect virtual bases, the  
vtable pointers have to be set to the addresses of construction
vtables. This is because the normal base class vtables may not hold  
the correct virtual base index values to access the virtual bases of  
the object under construction, and adjustment addressed by these
vtables may hold
the wrong this parameter adjustment if the adjustment is to cast
from a virtual base to another part of the object. The problem is
that a complete object of a base class and a complete object of a
derived class do not have virtual bases at the same offsets.

<p>
A construction vtable holds the virtual function addresses and the
RTTI information associated with the base class and the virtual base  
indexes and the addresses of adjustor entry points with this
parameter adjustments associated with objects of the complete class.

<p>
To ensure that the vtable pointers are set to the appropriate
vtables during base class construction, a table of vtable pointers,  
called the VTT, which holds the addresses of construction and
non-construction vtables is generated for the complete class. The
constructor for the complete class passes to each base class
constructor a pointer to the appropriate place in the VTT where the  
base class constructor can find its set of vtables. Construction
vtables are used in a similar way during the execution of base class  
destructors.

The above arrived to late for everyone to read it carefully.
It was agreed that we would consider it outside the meetings,
discuss any issues noted by email,
and attempt to close on 22 July.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Note that putting GP in the Vtable prevents putting it in shared memory.
This interacts with B-4.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 HP -- Cary]</font>
For a C++ object to be placed into shared memory,
its vtable pointer must be valid in all processes
that are sharing that object.

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the vtable can be placed in text, that would be fine,
but the vtable contains function pointers (or descriptors)
that require runtime relocation, so it must be in data.

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in shared memory,
but only if the function pointers/descriptors are valid in all processes.
The entry point addresses, which refer to shared text, should be shareable,
but the gp values may not be identical for all processes.
(RTTI pointers are also an issue,
and could be solved by putting the RTTI information in shared memory as well.)

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in private memory,
provided they are at the same address in all processes.
</ol>

<p>
One way or another,
we need a way of ensuring that a pointer from shared 
memory to private memory is valid in all processes,
which means that we will need a means to ensure that certain shared
library data segments can get mapped at the same address in all
processes that load those certain libraries.

<p>
My wild idea a few years ago was to put the vtables in shared memory
(by allocating and building them at load time, as Taligent did),
and store a shared library index in place of the gp value
in each function descriptor.
Each process would have its own table of gp values,
indexed by this shared library index,
but the index space would be managed system-wide.
The C++ runtime library would have been responsible for allocating
a new index for each unique C++ shared library loaded on the system,
then storing the process-local copy of the gp pointer in the 
appropriate slot of the table.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990628 SGI -- Jim]</font>
Note a further problem with vtables in shared memory (Cary's point 2).
If a virtual function comes from another DSO,
it may be pre-empted differently in different programs.
Hence, the function pointer itself is a problem even if the GP isn't.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 All]</font>
An extensive discussion boiled down to a few points:
<ul>
<p>
<li> The primary issue is objects in shared memory --
    vtables aren't interesting in themselves, but rather because
    putting the object in shared memory implies having the vtable at
    the same address in all sharing processes.

<p>
<li> Many of us have a few customers asking for this.
    It is not clear just how extensive a facility they need,
    or how automatic it needs to be.
    We should attempt to gauge the need.

<p>
<li> Noone thinks we should penalize the non-shared case for
    the rare instances of shared demand.

<p>
<li> It is questionable whether we can define an ABI mechanism
    which will work on all of our systems,
    but we'd like not to preclude OS-specific extensions to do
    this if we can't.

<p>
<li> One possible approach would be an API allowing a user to
    place an object in shared memory,
    and then "install" it by setting its vtable pointers,
    possibly to copies also placed in the same shared memory.

<p>
<li> A more automatic approach would be something which allocated
    certain objects/vtables to shared memory,
    gave up at link time if not all pointers were internal to the
    object being linked,
    attempted to place the relevant segments at the same runtime
    addresses to allow sharing,
    and gave up on sharing if this was not possible.
    Such an approach would perhaps still require some care on the part
    of the user to prevent problematic runtime situations.
</ul>

<p>
These ideas are very fuzzy.
Participants should think about the need and possibilities and attempt
to identify more concrete approaches.

<b>Summary</b>:
Static objects with dynamic constructors must be constructed at
intialization time.
This is done via the executable object initialization functions that
are identified (in ELF) by the DT_INIT and DT_INITARRAY dynamic tags.
How should the compiler identify the constructors to be called in this way?
One traditional mechanism is to put calls in a .init section.
Another, used by HP, is to put function addresses in a .initarray section.
<p>
The dual question arises for static object destructors.
Again, the extant mechanisms include putting calls in a .fini section,
or putting function addresses in a .finiarray section.
<p>
Finally, which mechanism (DT_INIT or DT_INITARRAY, or the FINI versions)
should be used in linked objects?
The gABI, and the IA-64 psABI, will support both,
with DT_INIT being executed before the DT_INITARRAY elements.

<b>Summary</b>:
Given that the compiler has identified constructor/destructor calls for
static objects in each relocatable object, in what order should the
static linker combine them in the linked executable object?
(The initialization order determines the finalization order,
as its opposite.)
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 All]</font>
Meeting concensus is that the desirable order is right to left on the
link command line, i.e. last listed relocatable object is initialized
first.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 SGI]</font>
We propose that global constructors be handled as follows:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The compiler shall emit global constructor calls as one or more entries
in an SHF_INIT_ARRAY section.
<p>
<li>
The linker shall combine them according to the rules of the base gABI,
namely as a concatenated array of entries, in link argument order,
pointed to by a DT_INIT_ARRAY tag.
(The linker may intersperse entries from command line flags or modules
from other languages, but that is beyond the C++ ABI scope.)
</ul>

<p>
This does not address the global destructor problem.
That solution needs to deal not only with the global objects seen by
the compiler, but also interspersed local static objects.
This treatment seems to be tied up in the question of how early
unloading of DSOs is handled, and the data structure used for that
purpose (issue C-3).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Cygnus scheme:
priorities are 16-bit unsigned integers, lower numbers are higher priority.
In each translation unit,
there's a single initialization function for each priority.
Anything that's prioritized has a higher priority than anything that
isn't explicitly assigned a priority.

<p>
IBM scheme:
priorities are 32-bit signed integers, higher numbers are higher priority.
Something that isn't explicitly assigned a priority effectively
gets a priority of 0.

<p>
Consensus:
nobody is sure that negative priorities are very important,
but also nobody can think of a reason not to allow them.
We accept the idea that priorities are 32-bit signed integers.
On a source level Cygnus will keep lower numbers as higher priority,
but that's a source issue, not an ABI issue.

<p>
Status: No real technical issues,
we have consensus on everything that matters.
We need to write up the finicky details.

<b>Summary</b>:
Given the constructor/destructor calls for each executable object
comprising a program, what is the order of execution between objects?
For constructors, there is not much question:
unless we choose some explicit means of control,
file-scope objects will be initialized by the DT_INIT/DT_INITARRAY
functions in the order determined by the base ABI order rules,
and local objects will be initialized in the order their containing
scopes are entered.
<p>
For destructors, the Standard requires opposite-order destruction,
which implies a runtime structure to keep track of the order.
Furthermore, the potential for dynamic unloading of a DSO
(e.g. by dlclose)
requires a mechanism for early destruction of a subset.

The relevant Standard requirement is 12.8/15,

For cases where the ctor may not be elided,
we expect to perform the copy at the call site,

How should we handle local static variables in inlines?
G++ currently avoids this issue by suppressing
inlining of functions with local statics.
If we don't want to do that,
we'll need to specify a mangling for the statics,
and handle multiple copies like we do above.

<b>Summary</b>:
The Standard requires that local static objects with dynamic

Multi-threading renders the simple check of a flag before
initialization inadequate to prevent multiple initialization.
Should the ABI require locking for this purpose,
and if so, what are the necessary interfaces?
In addition to the locking of the initialization,
special exception handling treatment is required to deal with an
exception during construction.

The standard is mute on multiple threads of control in general, so 
there is no requirement in the language to support what I'm talking
about. But as a practical matter compilers have to do it (Watcom gave
a paper on their approach during the standardization process, if I
remember).  This example using UI/SVR4 threads will usually show
whether a compiler does it or not: 

<pre><code>
thr5.C:
// static local initialization and threads

#include <stdlib.h>
#define EXIT(a) exit(a)
#define THR_EXIT() thr_exit(0)

#include <thread.h>

int init_count = 0;
int start_count = 0;

int init()
{
  
        ::thr_yield();
        return ++init_count;
}

void* start(void* s)
{
  
        start_count++;
        static int i = init();
        if (i != 1) EXIT(5);
        THR_EXIT();
        return 0;
}
                
int main()
{
  
        thread_t t1, t2;
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t1) != 0) EXIT(1);
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t2) != 0) EXIT(2);
        if (::thr_join(t1, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(3);
        if (::thr_join(t2, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(4);
        if (start_count != 2)
                EXIT(6);
        if (init_count != 1)
                EXIT(7);
        THR_EXIT();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
When compiled with CC -Kthread thr5.C on UnixWare 7, for instance,
it passes by returning 0.  When compiled with CC -mt thr5.C on
Solaris/x86 C++ 4.2 (sorry don't have the latest version!), it
fails by returning 5.


<p>
<font color=blue>[990607 Sun -- Mike Ball]</font>
As far as I can tell, the language says that the automatic blocking 
issue isn't a valid approach.  It says what has to happen, and
it isn't that.

<p>
If you look at the entire statement you find that it reads:
<quote>
"Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes
through its declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon
the completion of its initialization.
If the initialization exits by throwing an exception,
the initialization is not complete,
so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration.
If control re-enters the declaration (recursively)
while the object is being initialized,
the behavior is undefined."
</quote>

<p>
The word "recursively" is normative,
so eliminates that sentence from consideration.

<p>
One can, of course, make any extension to the language,
but in this case I think the extension invalidates some otherwise valid code.

<p>
The sentence I'm referring to is that the object is considered
initialized upon the completion of its initialization.
This is explicit, and the reason for it is covered in the following sentence,
which discusses an initialization that terminates with an exception.
A person catching such an exception has the right to try again
without danger that the static variable will be initialized in the meantime.

<p>
I don't see anything at all to justify semantics that say,
"after initialization is started, Any other threads of control are
blocked until that thread completes the initialization,
unless, of course, it executes by an exception,
in which case the other thread can do the initialization before the
exception handler gets a chance to try again, except...."
 Take an attempt to define the semantics as far as you like.

<p>
The problem is that there is no way for the compiler writer to know
what the programmer really wanted to do.
I can (and will at some other date, if necessary)
come up with scenarios justifying a variety of mutual exclusion policies,
including none.

<p>
The solution is to let the programmer write the mutual exclusion, the
same as we do for every other potential race condition.
It's a real mess, and, I claim, an unwise one to put in as an extension.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990608 HP -- Christophe]</font>
The semantics currently implemented in the HP aC++ compiler is as follows:
<ul>
<li> No two thread can enter a static initialization at the same time
<li> Threads are blocked until immediately after the static  
    initialization either succeeds or fails with an exception.
</ul>

<p>
There are details of our implementation that I disagree with, but in  
general, the semantics seem clear and sane, not as convoluted as you  
seemed to imply. In particular, it correctly covers the case where  
the static initialization fails with an exception. Any thread at that  
point can attempt the initialization.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990608 SCO -- Jonathan]</font>
Here's what the SCO UnixWare 7 C++ compiler does for IA-32,
from a (slightly sanitized) design document.
 It meets Jim's goal of having no overhead for non-threaded programs
and minimal overhead for threaded programs unless
actual contention occurs (infrequent),
and meets Mike's goal of handling exceptions in the initialization correctly
(although it doesn't guarantee that the thread getting the exception is
the one that gets next crack at initializing the static).
 It's also worth noting that dynamic initialization of local variables
(static or otherwise) is very common in C++,
since that's what most object constructions involve,
so I don't think this case is as rare as Jim does.


<p>
[...] This is in local static variables with dynamic initialization,
where the compiler generates out a static one-time flag to guard the
initialization.
Two threads could read the flag as zero before either of them set it,
resulting in multiple initializations.

<p>
[...] Accordingly, when compilation is done with -Kthread on,
a code sequence will be generated to lock this initialization.  
[...] the basic idea is to have one guard saying whether the
initialization is done (so that multiple initializations do not occur)
and have another guard saying whether initialization is in progress
(so that a second thread doesn't access what it thinks is
an initialized value before the first thread has finished the
initialization).  [...]

<p>
When compiled with -Kthread, the generated code for a dynamic
initialization of a local static variable will look like the
following. guard is a local static boolean, initialized to zero,
generated by the [middle pass of the compiler]. 
Two bits of it are used: the low-order 'done bit'
and the next-low-order 'busy bit'.

<pre><code>
.again:
        movl    $guard,%eax
        testl   $1,(%eax)       // test the done bit
        jnz     .done           // if set, variable is initialized,
done
        lock; btsl  $1,(%eax)   // test and set the busy bit
        jc      .busy
        < init code >           // not busy, do the initialization
        movl    $guard,%eax
        movl    $3,(%eax)       // set the done bit
        jmp     .done
.busy:
        pushl   %eax            // call RTS routine to wait, passing address
        call1   __static_init_wait      // of guard to monitor
        testl   %eax,%eax       // 1 means exception occurred in init code,
        popl    %ecx
        jnz     .again                  // start the whole thing over
.done                                   // 0 means wait finished
</code></pre>

<p>
The above code will work for position-independent code as well.

The complication due to exceptions is:
what happens if the initialization code throws an exception?
The [compiler] EH tables will have set up a special region and flag in
their region table to detect this situation,
along with a pointer to the guard variable.
Because the initialization never completed,
when the RTS sees that it is cleaning up from such a region,
it will reset the guard variable back to both zeroes.
This will free up a busy-waiting thread, if any,
or will reset everything for the next thread that calls the function.

<p>
The idea of the __static_init_wait() RTS routine is to monitor the
value of guard bits passed in, by looping on this decision table:
<pre><code>
    done    busy
    0       0       return 1 in %eax        (EH wipe-out)
    1       1       return 0 in %eax        (no longer busy)
    0       1       continue to wait        (still busy)
    1       0       internal error, shouldn't happen
</code></pre>

<p>
As for how the wait is done [... not relevant for ABI,
although currently we're using thr_yield(),
which may or may not be right for this context].

<p>
<font color=blue>[990608 SGI -- Hans]</font>
I'd like to make some claims about function scope static constructor
calls in multithreaded environments.
I personally can't recall ever having used such a construct,
which somewhat substantiates my claims,
but also implies some lack of certainty.
I'd be interested in hearing any arguments to the contrary.

<p>
I believe that these arguments imply that this problem is not important
enough to warrant added ABI complexity or overhead for sequential code.

<p>
Consider the following skeletal example:

<p><code>
f(int x) { static foo a(...); ... }
</code>

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the constructor argument doesn't depend on the function parameter,
and the code behaves reasonably, it should be possible to rewrite this as

<p><code>
static foo a(...);
<br>
f(int x) { ... }
</code>

<p>
<li>
If I read the standard correctly (and that's a big disclaimer),
the compiler is entitled to perform the above transformation under
conditions that are usually true,
but hard for the compiler to deduce.
Thus code that relies on the initialization occurring during the
execution of f is usually broken.

<p>
<li>
Thus the foo constructor cannot rely on its caller holding any locks.
It must explicitly acquire any locks it needs.

<p>
<li>
It is far preferable to write the transformed form with a file scope
static variable to start with.
The initial form risks deadlock,
since f may be called with locks held which the constructor
can't assume are held.
If it needs one of those locks it will need to reacquire it.
With default mutex semantics that results in deadlock with itself.
(If locks may be reentered,
it may fail in a more subtle manner since the foo constructor may
acquire a monitor lock whose monitor invariant doesn't hold.)

<p>
<li>
File scope static constructor calls aren't a problem and require no locking,
since they are executed in a single thread before main is called or
before dlopen returns.
(Forking a thread in a static constructor should probably be disallowed.
Threads may not have been fully initialized, among other issues.)

<p>
<li>
Static function scope constructor calls which depend on function
arguments are likely to involve a race condition anyway,
if multiple instances of the function can be invoked concurrently.
Any of the calls might determine the constructor parameters.
Thus these aren't very interesting either.
And if they are really needed, they can be replaced with a file scope
static constructor call plus an assignment.
