<h3> Revisions </h3>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990625]</font>
Closed A-1, A-2, A-4, A-8, A-9.
Additions to A-3, A-5, A-7, B-4, B-5, B-7, G-3, G-4.
New issues B-6, B-7, B-8, C-7, C-8.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990616]</font>
Added HP summaries.
Added sketchy notes from 990610 discussions (A and B issues).
A-10 was intended by HP as something different than I described,
so it was renamed, and a new issue A-13 opened as an SGI issue.
HP did not submit A-12, so relabeled as Sun's (is that right?).
Added library interface issues, H-1 and H-2.

<h3> Definitions </h3>

<p>
The issues below make use of the following definitions:

<dl>

<p>
<dt> <i>empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class with no non-static data members,
no virtual functions, no virtual base classes,
and no non-empty non-virtual base classes.)

<p>
<dt> <i>nearly empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class, the objects of which contain only a Vptr.

<p>
<dt> <i>vague linkage</i> </dt>
<dd>
The treatment of entities --
e.g. inline functions, templates, vtables --
with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.

</dl>

At offset zero is the Vptr whenever there is one,
as well as the primary base class if any (see A-7).
Also at offset zero is any number of empty base classes,
as long as that does not place multiple subobjects of the same type at
the same offset.
If there are multiple empty base classes such that placing two of them
at offset zero would violate this constraint, the first is placed there.
(First means in declaration order.)

<p>
All other non-virtual base classes are laid out in declaration order at
the beginning of the class.
All other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
The above ignores issues of padding for alignment,
and possible reordering of class members to fit in padding areas.
See issue A-9.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
There remains an issue concerning the selection of the primary base
class (see A-7), but we are otherwise in agreement.
We will attempt to close this on 1 July, modulo A-7.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990623 SGI]</font>
We propose that no parameter slot be allocated to such parameters,
i.e. that no register be used,
and that no space in the parameter memory sequence be used.
This implies that the callee must allocate storage at a unique address
if the address is taken (which we expect to be rare).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
In addition to the address-taken case,
care is required if the object has a non-trivial copy constructor.
HP observes that in (some?) such cases,
they perform the construction at the call site and pass the object by
reference.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990625 SGI -- Jim]</font>
I understand that the Standard explicitly allows elimination of
even non-trivial copy construction in some cases.
Is this one of them?  Where should I look?
Also, of course, varargs processing for elided empty parameters would
need to be careful.

<p>
I have opened a new issue (C-7) for passing copy-constructed
parameters by reference.
Since doing so would turn an empty value parameter
into a non-empty reference parameter,
this issue can ignore such cases.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990617 All]</font>
It will be shared with the first polymorphic non-virtual base class,
or if none, with the first nearly empty polymorphic virtual base class.
(See A-2 for the definition of <i>nearly empty</i>.)

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
HP noted that Taligent chooses a base class with virtual bases before
one without as the primary base class),
probably to avoid additional "this" pointer adjustments.
SGI observed that such a rule would prevent users from controlling the
choice by their ordering of the base classes in the declaration.
The bias of the group remains the above resolution,
but HP will attempt to find the Taligent rationale before this is decided.

There are several methods for adjusting the <i>this</i> pointer

a slightly unusual approach such as using secondary entry points

One possibility is to have two Vtable entries,
which might point to different functions, different entrypoints,
or a real entrypoint and a thunk.
Another is to return two result pointers (base/derived),
and have the caller select the right one.

<b>Summary</b>:
The contents of the vtable can sometimes be modified,
but the concensus is that it is nonetheless always allowed to "cache" elements,
i.e. to retain them in registers and reuse them,
whenever it is really useful.
However, this may sometimes break "beyond the standard" code,
such as code loading a shared library that replaces a virtual function.
Can we all agree when caching is allowed?

<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
In C++, there are various things with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.
From the user's standpoint, this applies to inlines and templates.
From the implementation's perspective,
it also applies to things like vtables and RTTI info.
(We call this <i>vague linkage</i>.)
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
There are several ways of dealing with vague linkage items:
<ol>
<li> Emit them everywhere and only use one.
<li> Use some heuristic to decide where to emit them.
<li> Use a database to decide where to emit them.
<li> Generate them at link time.
</ol>

<p>
#3 and #4 are feasible for templates,
but I consider them too heavyweight to be used for other things.

<p>
The typical heuristic for #2 is "with the first non-inline,
non-abstract virtual function in the class".
This works pretty well,
but fails for classes that have no such virtual function,
and for non-member inlines.
Worse, the heuristic may produce different results in different
translation units,
as a method could be defined inline after being declared non-inline
in the class body.
So we have to handle multiple copies in some cases anyway.

<p>
The way to handle this in standard ELF is weak symbols.
If all definitions are marked weak,
the linker will choose one
and the others will just sit there taking up space.

<p>
Christophe mentioned the other day that the HP compiler used the
typical heuristic above,
and handled the case of different results by encoding the
key function in the vtable name.
But this seems unnecessary when we can just choose one of multiple defns.

<p>
A better solution than weak symbols alone would be to set things up so
that the linker will discard the extra copies.
Various existing implementations of this are:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
The Microsoft PE/COFF defn includes support for COMDAT sections,
which key off of the first symbol defined.
One copy is chosen, others are discarded.
You can specify conditions to the linker
(must have same contents, must have same size).

<p>
<li>
The IBM XCOFF platform includes a garbage-collecting linker;
sections that are not referenced in a sweep from main are discarded.
In xlC, template instantiations are emitted in separate sections,
with encoded names;
at link time, one copy is renamed to the real mangled name,
and the others are discarded by garbage collection.
</ol>

<p>
The GNU ELF toolchain does a variant of #1 here;
any sections with names beginning with ".gnu.linkonce."
are treated as COMDAT sections.
It seems more sensible to me to key off of the section name
than the first symbol name as in PE.

<p>
The GNU linker recently added support for garbage collection,
and I've been thinking about changing our handling of vague
linkage to make use of it, but haven't.

<p>
I propose that the ia64 base ABI be extended to
provide for either COMDAT sections or garbage collection,
and that we use that support for vague linkage.

<p>
I further propose that we not use heuristics to
cut down the number of copies ahead of time;
they usually work fine, but can cause problems in some situations,
such as when not all of the class's members are in the same symbol space.
Does the ia64 ABI provide for controlling which symbols
are exported from a shared library?

<p>
A side issue: What do we want to do with
dynamically-initialized variables?
The same thing, or use COMMON?
I propose COMMON.

<p>
See also G-3, for vague linkage of inlined routines and their static variables.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 SGI summarizing others]</font>
HP uses COMDAT for many cases, keying from the symbol names.
HP also uses some heuristics.
HP observes that IA-64 objects will already be large.
From the base ABI discussions,
any use of WEAK or COMMON symbols will need to take care not to depend
on vendor-specific treatment.

<p>
Defining a COMDAT mechanism doesn't preclude using heuristics to avoid
some copies up front.
A COMDAT mechanism should also specify how to get rid of associated
sections like debugging info, unless the identical mechanism works.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990629 HP -- Christophe]</font>
First, the "usual" heuristic
(which is usual because it dates back to Cfront)
is to emit vtables in the translation unit that contains  
the definition of the first non inline, non pure virtual function.  
That is, for:
<pre><code>
        struct X {
                void a();
                virtual void f() { return; }
                virtual void g() = 0;
                virtual void h();
                virtual void i();
        };
</code></pre>
the vtable is emitted only in the TU that contains the definition of h().

<p>
This breaks and becomes non-portable if:
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing. In that case,
    you generally emit duplicate versions of vtables
<li>There is a "change of mind",
    such as having the above class followed by:
    <code><p>
    <dd>inline void X::h() { f(); }
    </code>

<p>
Now, the COMDAT issue is as follows:
a COMDAT section is, in some cases, slightly more difficult to handle
(at least, that's the impression Jason gave me).
For statics with runtime initialization,  
what you can do is reserve COMMON space ('easier'),
then initialize that space at runtime.
As I said, the problem is if two compilers disagree on whether this
is a runtime or a compile time initialization, such as in :
<pre><code>
	int f() { return 1; }
	int x = f();	// Static (COMDAT) or Dynamic (COMMON) initialization?
</code></pre>

<p>
So I personally recommend that we put everything in COMDAT.

<font color=blue>[990624 All]</font>
Note that putting GP in the Vtable prevents putting it in shared memory.
This interacts with B-4.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 HP -- Cary]</font>
For a C++ object to be placed into shared memory,
its vtable pointer must be valid in all processes
that are sharing that object.

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the vtable can be placed in text, that would be fine,
but the vtable contains function pointers (or descriptors)
that require runtime relocation, so it must be in data.

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in shared memory,
but only if the function pointers/descriptors are valid in all processes.
The entry point addresses, which refer to shared text, should be shareable,
but the gp values may not be identical for all processes.
(RTTI pointers are also an issue,
and could be solved by putting the RTTI information in shared memory as well.)

<p>
<li>
We can place the vtables in private memory,
provided they are at the same address in all processes.
</ol>

<p>
One way or another,
we need a way of ensuring that a pointer from shared 
memory to private memory is valid in all processes,
which means that we will need a means to ensure that certain shared
library data segments can get mapped at the same address in all
processes that load those certain libraries.

<p>
My wild idea a few years ago was to put the vtables in shared memory
(by allocating and building them at load time, as Taligent did),
and store a shared library index in place of the gp value
in each function descriptor.
Each process would have its own table of gp values,
indexed by this shared library index,
but the index space would be managed system-wide.
The C++ runtime library would have been responsible for allocating
a new index for each unique C++ shared library loaded on the system,
then storing the process-local copy of the gp pointer in the 
appropriate slot of the table.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990628 SGI -- Jim]</font>
Note a further problem with vtables in shared memory (Cary's point 2).
If a virtual function comes from another DSO,
it may be pre-empted differently in different programs.
Hence, the function pointer itself is a problem even if the GP isn't.

intialization time.
This is done via the executable object initialization functions that
are identified (in ELF) by the DT_INIT and DT_INITARRAY dynamic tags.
How should the compiler identify the constructors to be called in this way?
One traditional mechanism is to put calls in a .init section.
Another, used by HP, is to put function addresses in a .initarray section.
<p>
The dual question arises for static object destructors.
Again, the extant mechanisms include putting calls in a .fini section,
or putting function addresses in a .finiarray section.
<p>
Finally, which mechanism (DT_INIT or DT_INITARRAY, or the FINI versions)
should be used in linked objects?
The gABI, and the IA-64 psABI, will support both,
with DT_INIT being executed before the DT_INITARRAY elements.

<b>Summary</b>:
Given the constructor/destructor calls for each executable object
comprising a program, what is the order of execution between objects?
For constructors, there is not much question:
unless we choose some explicit means of control,
file-scope objects will be initialized by the DT_INIT/DT_INITARRAY
functions in the order determined by the base ABI order rules,
and local objects will be initialized in the order their containing
scopes are entered.
<p>
For destructors, the Standard requires opposite-order destruction,
which implies a runtime structure to keep track of the order.
Furthermore, the potential for dynamic unloading of a DSO
(e.g. by dlclose)
requires a mechanism for early destruction of a subset.

How should we handle local static variables in inlines?
G++ currently avoids this issue by suppressing
inlining of functions with local statics.
If we don't want to do that,
we'll need to specify a mangling for the statics,

The standard is mute on multiple threads of control in general, so 
there is no requirement in the language to support what I'm talking
about. But as a practical matter compilers have to do it (Watcom gave
a paper on their approach during the standardization process, if I
remember).  This example using UI/SVR4 threads will usually show
whether a compiler does it or not: 

<pre><code>
thr5.C:
// static local initialization and threads

#include <stdlib.h>
#define EXIT(a) exit(a)
#define THR_EXIT() thr_exit(0)

#include <thread.h>

int init_count = 0;
int start_count = 0;

int init()
{
  
        ::thr_yield();
        return ++init_count;
}

void* start(void* s)
{
  
        start_count++;
        static int i = init();
        if (i != 1) EXIT(5);
        THR_EXIT();
        return 0;
}
                
int main()
{
  
        thread_t t1, t2;
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t1) != 0) EXIT(1);
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t2) != 0) EXIT(2);
        if (::thr_join(t1, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(3);
        if (::thr_join(t2, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(4);
        if (start_count != 2)
                EXIT(6);
        if (init_count != 1)
                EXIT(7);
        THR_EXIT();
}
</code></pre>

When compiled with CC -Kthread thr5.C on UnixWare 7, for instance,
it passes by returning 0.  When compiled with CC -mt thr5.C on

fails by returning 5.


<p>
<font color=blue>[990607 Sun -- Mike Ball]</font>
As far as I can tell, the language says that the automatic blocking 
issue isn't a valid approach.  It says what has to happen, and
it isn't that.

<p>
If you look at the entire statement you find that it reads:
<quote>
"Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes
through its declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon
the completion of its initialization.
If the initialization exits by throwing an exception,
the initialization is not complete,
so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration.
If control re-enters the declaration (recursively)
while the object is being initialized,
the behavior is undefined."
</quote>

<p>
The word "recursively" is normative,
so eliminates that sentence from consideration.

<p>
One can, of course, make any extension to the language,
but in this case I think the extension invalidates some otherwise valid code.

<p>
The sentence I'm referring to is that the object is considered
initialized upon the completion of its initialization.
This is explicit, and the reason for it is covered in the following sentence,
which discusses an initialization that terminates with an exception.
A person catching such an exception has the right to try again
without danger that the static variable will be initialized in the meantime.

<p>
I don't see anything at all to justify semantics that say,
"after initialization is started, Any other threads of control are
blocked until that thread completes the initialization,
unless, of course, it executes by an exception,
in which case the other thread can do the initialization before the
exception handler gets a chance to try again, except...."
 Take an attempt to define the semantics as far as you like.

<p>
The problem is that there is no way for the compiler writer to know
what the programmer really wanted to do.
I can (and will at some other date, if necessary)
come up with scenarios justifying a variety of mutual exclusion policies,
including none.

<p>
The solution is to let the programmer write the mutual exclusion, the
same as we do for every other potential race condition.
It's a real mess, and, I claim, an unwise one to put in as an extension.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990608 HP -- Christophe]</font>
The semantics currently implemented in the HP aC++ compiler is as follows:
<ul>
<li> No two thread can enter a static initialization at the same time
<li> Threads are blocked until immediately after the static  
    initialization either succeeds or fails with an exception.
</ul>

<p>
There are details of our implementation that I disagree with, but in  
general, the semantics seem clear and sane, not as convoluted as you  
seemed to imply. In particular, it correctly covers the case where  
the static initialization fails with an exception. Any thread at that  
point can attempt the initialization.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990608 SCO -- Jonathan]</font>
Here's what the SCO UnixWare 7 C++ compiler does for IA-32,
from a (slightly sanitized) design document.
 It meets Jim's goal of having no overhead for non-threaded programs
and minimal overhead for threaded programs unless
actual contention occurs (infrequent),
and meets Mike's goal of handling exceptions in the initialization correctly
(although it doesn't guarantee that the thread getting the exception is
the one that gets next crack at initializing the static).
 It's also worth noting that dynamic initialization of local variables
(static or otherwise) is very common in C++,
since that's what most object constructions involve,
so I don't think this case is as rare as Jim does.


<p>
[...] This is in local static variables with dynamic initialization,
where the compiler generates out a static one-time flag to guard the
initialization.
Two threads could read the flag as zero before either of them set it,
resulting in multiple initializations.

<p>
[...] Accordingly, when compilation is done with -Kthread on,
a code sequence will be generated to lock this initialization.  
[...] the basic idea is to have one guard saying whether the
initialization is done (so that multiple initializations do not occur)
and have another guard saying whether initialization is in progress
(so that a second thread doesn't access what it thinks is
an initialized value before the first thread has finished the
initialization).  [...]

<p>
When compiled with -Kthread, the generated code for a dynamic
initialization of a local static variable will look like the
following. guard is a local static boolean, initialized to zero,
generated by the [middle pass of the compiler]. 
Two bits of it are used: the low-order 'done bit'
and the next-low-order 'busy bit'.

<pre><code>
.again:
        movl    $guard,%eax
        testl   $1,(%eax)       // test the done bit
        jnz     .done           // if set, variable is initialized,
done
        lock; btsl  $1,(%eax)   // test and set the busy bit
        jc      .busy
        < init code >           // not busy, do the initialization
        movl    $guard,%eax
        movl    $3,(%eax)       // set the done bit
        jmp     .done
.busy:
        pushl   %eax            // call RTS routine to wait, passing address
        call1   __static_init_wait      // of guard to monitor
        testl   %eax,%eax       // 1 means exception occurred in init code,
        popl    %ecx
        jnz     .again                  // start the whole thing over
.done                                   // 0 means wait finished
</code></pre>

<p>
The above code will work for position-independent code as well.

The complication due to exceptions is:
what happens if the initialization code throws an exception?
The [compiler] EH tables will have set up a special region and flag in
their region table to detect this situation,
along with a pointer to the guard variable.
Because the initialization never completed,
when the RTS sees that it is cleaning up from such a region,
it will reset the guard variable back to both zeroes.
This will free up a busy-waiting thread, if any,
or will reset everything for the next thread that calls the function.

<p>
The idea of the __static_init_wait() RTS routine is to monitor the
value of guard bits passed in, by looping on this decision table:
<pre><code>
    done    busy
    0       0       return 1 in %eax        (EH wipe-out)
    1       1       return 0 in %eax        (no longer busy)
    0       1       continue to wait        (still busy)
    1       0       internal error, shouldn't happen
</code></pre>

<p>
As for how the wait is done [... not relevant for ABI,
although currently we're using thr_yield(),
which may or may not be right for this context].

I'd like to make some claims about function scope static constructor
calls in multithreaded environments.
I personally can't recall ever having used such a construct,
which somewhat substantiates my claims,
but also implies some lack of certainty.
I'd be interested in hearing any arguments to the contrary.

<p>
I believe that these arguments imply that this problem is not important
enough to warrant added ABI complexity or overhead for sequential code.

<p>
Consider the following skeletal example:

<p><code>
f(int x) { static foo a(...); ... }
</code>

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the constructor argument doesn't depend on the function parameter,
and the code behaves reasonably, it should be possible to rewrite this as

<p><code>
static foo a(...);
<br>
f(int x) { ... }
</code>

<p>
<li>
If I read the standard correctly (and that's a big disclaimer),
the compiler is entitled to perform the above transformation under
conditions that are usually true,
but hard for the compiler to deduce.
Thus code that relies on the initialization occurring during the
execution of f is usually broken.

<p>
<li>
Thus the foo constructor cannot rely on its caller holding any locks.
It must explicitly acquire any locks it needs.

<p>
<li>
It is far preferable to write the transformed form with a file scope
static variable to start with.
The initial form risks deadlock,
since f may be called with locks held which the constructor
can't assume are held.
If it needs one of those locks it will need to reacquire it.
With default mutex semantics that results in deadlock with itself.
(If locks may be reentered,
it may fail in a more subtle manner since the foo constructor may
acquire a monitor lock whose monitor invariant doesn't hold.)

<p>
<li>
File scope static constructor calls aren't a problem and require no locking,
since they are executed in a single thread before main is called or
before dlopen returns.
(Forking a thread in a static constructor should probably be disallowed.
Threads may not have been fully initialized, among other issues.)

<p>
<li>
Static function scope constructor calls which depend on function
arguments are likely to involve a race condition anyway,
if multiple instances of the function can be invoked concurrently.
Any of the calls might determine the constructor parameters.
Thus these aren't very interesting either.
And if they are really needed, they can be replaced with a file scope
static constructor call plus an assignment.
