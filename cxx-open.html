<h3> Definitions </h3>

<p>
The issues below make use of the following definitions:

<dl>

<p>
<dt> <i>empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class with no non-static data members,
no virtual functions, no virtual base classes,
and no non-empty non-virtual base classes.)

<p>
<dt> <i>nearly empty class</i> </dt>
<dd>
A class, the objects of which contain only a Vptr.

<p>
<dt> <i>vague linkage</i> </dt>
<dd>
The treatment of entities --
e.g. inline functions, templates, vtables --
with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.

<b>Summary</b>:
There are several methods for adjusting the <i>this</i> pointer
for a member function call,
including thunks or offsets located in the vtable.
We need to agree on the mechanism used,
and on the location of offsets, if any are needed.
To maximize performance on IA64,
a slightly unusual approach such as using secondary entry points
to perform the adjustment may actually prove interesting.

<p>
<h4>Open Issues Relevant To This Discussion</h4>

<ol>
<p>
<li>
Keeping all of a class in a single load module.
The vtable contains the target address and one copy of the target GP.
This implies that it is not in text, and that it is generated by dld.

<p>
<li>
Detailed layout of the virtual table.

<p>
<li>
How can we share class offsets?

</ol>


<p>
<h4> 1. Scope and "State of the Art"</h4>

<p>
The following proposal applies only to calls to virtual functions  
when a this pointer adjustment is required from a base class to a  
derived class.
Essentially, this means multiple inheritance, and the  
existence of two or more virtual table pointers (vptr)
in the complete object.
The multiple vptrs are required so that the layout  
of all bases is unchanged in the complete object.
There will be one additional vptr for each base class which already
required a vptr,  
but cannot be placed in the whole object so that it shares its vptr  
with the whole object.
Note: when the vptr is shared,
the base class  is said to be the "primary base class",
and there is only one such class.

<p>
For the primary base class, no pointer adjustment is needed.
For all  other bases, a pointer to the whole object is not a pointer
to the base class,
so whenever a pointer to the base class is needed,  
adjustment will occur.

<p>
In particular, when calling a virtual function,
one does not know in advance in which class the function was actually defined.
Depending on the actual class of the object pointed to,
pointer adjustment may be needed or not,
and the pointer adjustment value may vary from class to class.
The existing solution is to have the vtable point not to the function itself,
but to a "thunk" which does pointer adjustment when needed,
and then jumps to the actual function.  
Another possibility is to have an offset in the vtable,
which is used by the called function.
However, more often than not, this implies adding zero.

<p>
Virtual bases make things slightly more complicated.
In that case, the data layout is such that there is only
one instance of the virtual base in the whole object.
Therefore, the offset from a this  
pointer to a same virtual base may change along the inheritance tree.  
This is solved by placing an offset in the virtual table,
which is used to adjust the this pointer to the virtual base.


<p>
<h4> 2. Proposal and Rationale </h4>

<p>
My proposal is to replace thunks with offsets,
with two additional tricks:
<ul>
<li>
Give a virtual function two entry points,
so as to bypass the adjustment when it's known to be zero.
<li>
Moving the adjustment at call-site,
where it can be scheduled more easily,
using a "reasonable" value,
so that the adjustment is bypassed even more often.
</ul>

<p>
The thunks are believed to cost more on IA64 than they would on  
other platforms.
The reason is that they are small islands of code spread throughout the code,
where you cannot guarantee any cache locality.
Since they immediately follow an indirect branch,
chances are we will always encounter both a branch misprediction and a  
I-cache miss in a row.

<p>
On the other hand,
a virtual function call starts by reading the virtual function address.
Reading the offset immediately thereafter should almost never cause a
D-cache miss (cache locality should be good).
More often than not, no adjustment is needed,
or the adjustment will be done at call site correctly.
In the worst case scenario, we perform two adjustments,
one static at call site, and one dynamic in the callee,
but this case should be really infrequent.


<p>
<h4> 3. New Calling Convention </h4>

<p>
The new calling convention requires that the 'this' pointer on entry  
points to the class for which the virtual function is just defined.  
That is, for A::f(),
the pointer is an A* when the main entry of the function is reached.
If the actual pointer is not an A*,
then an adjusting entry point is used,
which immediately precedes the function.

<p>
In the following, we will assume the following examples:
<p>
<code><pre>
    struct A { virtual void f(); };
    struct B { virtual void g(); };
    struct C: A, B { }
    struct D : C { virtual void f(); virtual void g(); }
    struct E: Other, C { virtual void f(); virtual void g(); }
    struct F: D, E { virtual void f(); }

    void call_Cf(C *c) { c->f(); }
    void call_Cg(C *c) { c->g(); }
    void call_Df(D* d) { d->f(); }
    void call_Dg(D* d) { d->g(); }
    void call_Ef(E* e) { e->f(); }
    void call_Eg(E* e) { e->g(); }
    void call_Ff(F *ff) { ff->f(); }
    void call_Fg(F *ff) { ff->g(); }	// Invalid: ambiguous
</pre></code>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> a) Call site:
<dd>
The caller performs adjustment to match the class of the last  
overrider of the given function.

<ul>
<p>
<li> call_Cf will assume that the pointer needs to be cast to an A*,  
since C::f is actually A::f. Since A is the primary base class, no  
adjustment is done at call site.

<p>
<li> call_Cg is similar, but assumes that the actual type is a B*, and  
performs the adjustment, since B is not the primary base class.

<p>
<li> call_Df and call_Dg will assume that the pointer needs to be cast  
to a D*, which is where D::f is defined. No adjustment is performed  
at call site.
</ul>
</dd>


<p>
<dt> b) Callee
<dd>
<ul>
<p>
<li> A::f and B::g are defined in classes where there is a single vptr.  
They don't define a secondary entry point. Because of call-site  
conventions, they expect to always be called with the correct type.

<p>
<li> D::f is defined in a class where there is more than one vptr, so  
it needs a secondary entry point and an entry 'convert_to_D' in the  
vtable. That's because it can be potentially called with either an A*  
or a B*. There are two vtables, one for A in D, one for B in D. The  
D::f entry in A in D points to the non-adjusting entry point, since A  
shares its vptr.

<p>
<li> D::g requires a secondary entry point, that will read the same  
offset 'convert_to_D' from the vtable.

<p>
<li> E also will require a 'convert_to_E' entry in the vtable, but this  
time, the vtable for A in C will have to point to an adjusting entry  
point, since A no longer shares the vptr with E (assuming Other has  
a vptr). This vtable is also the vtable of C in E.
</ul>
</dd>


<p>
<dt> c) Offsets in the vtable
<dd>
Offsets have to be placed in the vtable at a position which does not  
conflict with any offset in the inheritance tree.

<p>
convert_to_D and convert_to_E are likely to be at the same offset in  
the vtable. This is not a problem, even if D and E are used in the  
same class, such as F, because this is the same offset in different  
vtables.

<ul>
<p>
<li> call_Fg is invalid, because it is ambiguous.

<p>
<li> A notation such as ((E*) ff)->g() can be used to disambiguate, but  
in that case, we don't use the same vtable (either the E in F or D  
in F vtable). The E in F vtable uses that offset as 'convert_to_E',  
whereas the D in F vtable uses that offset as 'convert_to_D'.

<p>
<li> Similarly, call_Cf called with an F object will actually be called  
with the E in F or D in F, which disambiguates which C is actually  
used. The actual C* passed will have been adjusted by the caller  
unambiguously, or the call will be invalid.

<p>
<li> For functions overriden in F, an entry 'convert_to_F' is created  
anyway. This entry will not overlap with either convert_to_E or  
convert_to_D.
</ul>

<p>
The fact that an offset is reserved does not mean that it is  
actually used. A vtable need to contain the offset only if it refers  
to a function that will use it. An offset of 0 is not needed, since  
the function pointer will point to the non-adjusting entry point in  
that case.
</dd>

</dl>


<p>
<h4> 4. Cases where adjustment is performed </h4>

<ul>
<p>
<li> For call_Cf: No adjustment is done at call site. No adjustment is  
done at callee site if the dynamic type is C,  or D, or D in F (that  
is, F casted to an E).

<p>
<li> For call_Cg: Adjustment to B* is done at call-site. No further  
adjustment is needed if the dynamic type is C, D, or D in F. On the  
other hand, a second adjustment may happen for an E or E in F,  
because C is not their primary base.
</ul>

<p>
In other words, adjustment is made only when necessary, and at a  
place where it is better scheduled than with thunks. The only bad  
case is double adjustment for call_Cg called with an E*. This case  
can probably be considered rare enough, compared to calls such as  
call_Cg called with a C*, where we now actually do the adjustment at  
the call-site.


<p>
<h4> 5. Comparing the code trails </h4>

<p>
Currently, the sequence for a virtual function call in a shared  
library will look as follows. I'm assuming +DD64, there would be some  
additional addp4 in +DD32. The trail below is the dynamic execution  
sequence. In bold and between #if/#endif, the affected code.

<p>
<code><pre>
        // Compute the address of the vptr in the object,
	// from the this pointer
        // Optional, since vptroffset is often 0.
	// This also adjusts to the class of the final overrider
        addi            Rthis=vptroffset_of_final_overrider,Rthis
        ;;
        // Load the vptr in a register
        ld8             Rvptr=[Rthis]
        ;;
        // Add the offset to get to the function descriptor pointer
	// in the vtable.  Never zero, this instruction is always generated
        addi            Rfndescr=fndescroffset,Rvptr
        ;;
        // (Assuming inlined stub) Load the function address and new GP
        ld8             Rfnaddr=[Rfndescr],8
        ;;
        // Load the new GP
        ld8             GP=[Rfndescr]
        mov             BRn=Rfnaddr
        ;;
        // Perform the actual branch to the target

        // ...
        // ... Branch misprediction almost always, followed by

Discussion of B-6 raises questions of impact on the above approach.
Christophe will look at the issues.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990826 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
[An alternative suggestion from Jason via email.]

<p>
Rather than per-function offsets, we have per-target type offsets.
These offsets (if any) are stored at a negative index from the vptr.
When a derived class D overrides a virtual function F from a base class B,
if no previously allocated offset slot can be reused,
we add one to the beginning of the vtable(s) of the closest base(s)
which are non-virtually derived from B.
In the case of non-virtual inheritance, that would be D's vtable;
in simple virtual inheritance, it would be B's.
The vtables are written out in one large block,
laid out like an object of the class,
so if B is a non-virtual base of D,
we can find the D vtable from the B vptr.

<p>
D::f then recieves a B*, loads the offset from the vtable,
and makes the adjustment to get a D*.
The plan is to also have a non-adjusting vtable entry in D's vtable,
so we don't have to do two adjustments to call D::f with a D*;
the implementation of this is up to the compiler.
I expect that for g++,
we will do the adjustment in a thunk which just falls into the main function.

<p>
The performance problems with classic thunks occur when the thunk is
not close enough to the function it jumps to for a pc-relative branch.
This cannot be avoided in certain cases of virtual inheritance,
where a derived class must whip up a thunk for a new adjustment
to a method it doesn't override.

<p>
In this case, we will only ever have one thunk per function,
so we don't even have to jump.
Except in the case of covariant returns, that is,
where we will have one per return adjustment.
But we know all necessary adjustments at the
point of definition of the function,
so they can all be within pc-relative branch range.

<p>
[Extensive discussion followed by email --
this suggestion is not completely correct,
but may be the basis of a workable solution.]

<p>
<font color=blue>[990831 Cygnus -- Ian]</font>
A couple of observations ...

<p>
<b>On the state of the art:</b>

<p>
The Microsoft approach is worth mentioning.
(I haven't seen it discussed --
though perhaps that is because of the patent situation.)

<p>
It allows zero-adjusting (i.e. non-thunking) calls for (almost)
every virtual function call in a non-virtual,
multiple inheritance hierarchy.

<p>
For those that are unfamiliar,
the idea is that all calls go via the base class vft and overriding
functions expect a pointer to the base class type.
(That is, if D::f overrides B::f, it expects the first
parameter to be of type B*, not D*.)
The callee does the necessary static adjustment to get to the
derived class 'this' pointer as needed.

<p>
It avoids requiring a thunk,
and it's often the case that the cost is zero in the callee because
the this-adjustment can be folded into other offset computations.

<p>
On the balance,
it could well win over all the other approaches being discussed here.
[Though, it may lose in some specific cases vs. Christophe's approach
where one would create additional extra entries in
the derived class vft.]

<p>
<b>On when to make extra virtual function table entries for functions:</b>

<p>
One of Cristophe's suggestions is sort-of separate
from the rest of the discussion:
making extra entries in the derived class' vft for some
overridden virtual functions.
It has the benefit of giving you a faster calls if you happen to be in
(or near) the derived class -- at the expense of space in the vft.

<p>
Of course, you can always make the call through the introducing base class,
so these extra entries are a pure space/time performance trade off
(w/ some unpredictable D-cache effects) and the cost/benefit analysis
will depend a little on what the rest of the strategy looks like.

<p>
The same idea is potentially applicable,
no matter what strategy you actually use for vft layout,
and different criteria for deciding what extra entries to make are possible.
For example,
creating an extra entry when overriding a function introduced in a
virtual base has the added benefit of avoiding a cast to a virtual
base at the call site.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990909 All]</font>
We are getting closer --
understanding of the alternatives is improving,
and Christophe may agree with the Jason/Brian proposal after more thought.
To make sure we really understand what we're agreeing to,
Jason and Christophe will write up more precise proposal(s).

<b>Summary</b>:
In C++, there are various things with external linkage that can be
defined in multiple translation units,
while the ODR requires that the program
behave as if there were only a single definition.
From the user's standpoint, this applies to inlines and templates.
From the implementation's perspective,
it also applies to things like vtables and RTTI info.
(We call this <i>vague linkage</i>.)
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990624 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
There are several ways of dealing with vague linkage items:
<ol>
<li> Emit them everywhere and only use one.
<li> Use some heuristic to decide where to emit them.
<li> Use a database to decide where to emit them.
<li> Generate them at link time.
</ol>

<p>
#3 and #4 are feasible for templates,
but I consider them too heavyweight to be used for other things.

<p>
The typical heuristic for #2 is "with the first non-inline,
non-abstract virtual function in the class".
This works pretty well,
but fails for classes that have no such virtual function,
and for non-member inlines.
Worse, the heuristic may produce different results in different
translation units,
as a method could be defined inline after being declared non-inline
in the class body.
So we have to handle multiple copies in some cases anyway.

<p>
The way to handle this in standard ELF is weak symbols.
If all definitions are marked weak,
the linker will choose one
and the others will just sit there taking up space.

<p>
Christophe mentioned the other day that the HP compiler used the
typical heuristic above,
and handled the case of different results by encoding the
key function in the vtable name.
But this seems unnecessary when we can just choose one of multiple defns.

<p>
A better solution than weak symbols alone would be to set things up so
that the linker will discard the extra copies.
Various existing implementations of this are:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
The Microsoft PE/COFF defn includes support for COMDAT sections,
which key off of the first symbol defined.
One copy is chosen, others are discarded.
You can specify conditions to the linker
(must have same contents, must have same size).

<p>
<li>
The IBM XCOFF platform includes a garbage-collecting linker;
sections that are not referenced in a sweep from main are discarded.
In xlC, template instantiations are emitted in separate sections,
with encoded names;
at link time, one copy is renamed to the real mangled name,
and the others are discarded by garbage collection.
</ol>

<p>
The GNU ELF toolchain does a variant of #1 here;
any sections with names beginning with ".gnu.linkonce."
are treated as COMDAT sections.
It seems more sensible to me to key off of the section name
than the first symbol name as in PE.

<p>
The GNU linker recently added support for garbage collection,
and I've been thinking about changing our handling of vague
linkage to make use of it, but haven't.

<p>
I propose that the ia64 base ABI be extended to
provide for either COMDAT sections or garbage collection,
and that we use that support for vague linkage.

<p>
I further propose that we not use heuristics to
cut down the number of copies ahead of time;
they usually work fine, but can cause problems in some situations,
such as when not all of the class's members are in the same symbol space.
Does the ia64 ABI provide for controlling which symbols
are exported from a shared library?

<p>
A side issue: What do we want to do with
dynamically-initialized variables?
The same thing, or use COMMON?
I propose COMMON.

<p>
See also G-3, for vague linkage of inlined routines and their static variables.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990624 SGI summarizing others]</font>
HP uses COMDAT for many cases, keying from the symbol names.
HP also uses some heuristics.
HP observes that IA-64 objects will already be large.
From the base ABI discussions,
any use of WEAK or COMMON symbols will need to take care not to depend
on vendor-specific treatment.

<p>
Defining a COMDAT mechanism doesn't preclude using heuristics to avoid
some copies up front.
A COMDAT mechanism should also specify how to get rid of associated
sections like debugging info, unless the identical mechanism works.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990629 HP -- Christophe]</font>
First, the "usual" heuristic
(which is usual because it dates back to Cfront)
is to emit vtables in the translation unit that contains  
the definition of the first non inline, non pure virtual function.  
That is, for:
<pre><code>
        struct X {
                void a();
                virtual void f() { return; }
                virtual void g() = 0;
                virtual void h();
                virtual void i();
        };
</code></pre>
the vtable is emitted only in the TU that contains the definition of h().

<p>
This breaks and becomes non-portable if:
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing. In that case,
    you generally emit duplicate versions of vtables
<li>There is a "change of mind",
    such as having the above class followed by:
    <code><p>
    <dd>inline void X::h() { f(); }
    </code>
</ul>

<p>
Now, the COMDAT issue is as follows:
a COMDAT section is, in some cases, slightly more difficult to handle
(at least, that's the impression Jason gave me).
For statics with runtime initialization,  
what you can do is reserve COMMON space ('easier'),
then initialize that space at runtime.
As I said, the problem is if two compilers disagree on whether this
is a runtime or a compile time initialization, such as in :
<pre><code>
	int f() { return 1; }
	int x = f();	// Static (COMDAT) or Dynamic (COMMON) initialization?
</code></pre>

<p>
So I personally recommend that we put everything in COMDAT.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Consensus so far: use a heuristic for vtable and typeinfo emission,
based on the definition of the key function.
(The first virtual function that is not
declared inline in the class definition.)
The vtable must be emitted where the key function is defined,
it may also be emitted in other translation units as well.
If there is no key function then the vtable must be emitted in any
translation unit that refers to the vtable in any way.

<p>
Implication: the linker must be prepared to discard duplicate vtables.
We want to use COMDAT sections for this
(and for other entities with vague linkage.)

<p>
Open issue: the elf format allows only 16 bits for section identifiers,
and typically two of those bits are already taken up for other things.
So we've only got 16k sections available,
which is unacceptable if we're creating lots of small sections.

<p>
Jason - COMDATs disappear into text and data at link time,
so the issue is really only serious if we've got more than 16k vtables
(or template instantiations, etc.)
in a single translation unit.

<p>
Daveed - HP has gotten around this problem by hacking their ELF files
to steal another 8 bits from somewhere else.

<p>
Jack - a new kind of section table could be a viable solution.
However, it would break everything if we did it for ia32.
Is a solution that only works on ia64 acceptable?
Note also that the elf section table has its own string table,
which we wouldn't be able to share with the new kind of section table.
Index and link fields often point into section table,
we would have to figure out how to deal with this.
(Jack is not opposed to the idea of an alternate section table,
he is just pointing out some of the issues we will have to resolve.)


<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990805 All]</font>

<h2> C++ ABI:  COMDAT Proposal </h2>

<p>
<h3> Revisions </h3>

<p>
<font color=blue>[991007]</font>
Change default to simply group; COMDAT semantics is option.
Don't support removal based on duplication of non-COMDAT sections.
Just remove symbols defined relative to removed sections.

<p>
<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>
C++ has many situations where the compiler may need to emit code or data,
but may not be able to identify a unique compilation unit
where it should be emitted.
The approach chosen by the C++ ABI group to deal with this problem,
is to allow the compiler to emit the required information in multiple
compilation units,
in a form which allows the linker to remove all but one copy.
This is essentially the idea called COMDAT in several existing
implementations.

<p>
Various other implementations (notably Windows NT) and proposals obtain
more generality by varying the duplicate removal semantics.
The most obviously useful variant supports grouping of sections for
removal purposes, but treats duplication as an error,
using it to support link-time removal of unreferenced sections.
The proposal below treats this simple grouping as the default semantics,
and provides duplicate removal as an option.

<p>
Our objectives include:

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Use existing structures as far as possible,
to minimize impact on existing tools.

<p>
<li>
Minimize impact on the linker by defining the unit of duplication
as a section.

<p>
<li>
Maximize generality.
The C++ needs are rather varied,
and similar needs from other languages should also be handled.

<p>
<li>
In general, duplicated code or data sections are accompanied by
additional duplicated sections, e.g. containing debug information.
We want to define a mechanism which can deal with arbitrary such
associations, without predicting them in advance.

</ul>

<p>
<h3> Proposal </h3>

<p>
The proposal below is based on the HP definition,
with minor modifications and more precise definitions.

<p>
<h4> SHF_GROUP: Group Member Sections </h4>

A section which is part of a group,
and is to be retained or discarded with the group as a whole,
is identified by a new section header attribute:

<dl>
<dt> SHF_GROUP
<dd> This section is a member (perhaps the only one) of a group of sections,
    and the linker should retain or discard all or none of the members.
    This section must be referenced in a SHT_GROUP section (see below).
</dl>

<p>
This attribute flag may be set in any section header,
and no other modification or indication is made in the grouped sections.
All additional information is contained in the associated
SHT_GROUP section (see below).

<p>
<h4> SHT_GROUP: Section Group Definition </h4>

<p>
Some sections occur in interrelated groups.
For instance, an out-of-line definition of an inline function might require,
in addition to its .text section,
a read-only data section containing literals referenced,
one or more debug information sections,
and/or other informational sections.
Furthermore, there may be internal references among these sections that
would not make sense if one of them were removed or
replaced by a duplicate from another object.
Therefore, we assume that such groups are to be included or omitted
from the linked object as a unit.
(Except for the GRP_COMDAT flag described below,
this definition does not specify the circumstances under which the
members of a group might be discarded from the linked object.)

<p>
To facilitate this, we define a SHT_GROUP section:

<p>
The section header attributes of a Group Section are:

<p>
<TABLE align=center BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

<TR>
<TD><b> name </b></TD>
<TD> unspecified </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><code> sh_type </code></TD>
<TD><code> SHT_GROUP </code></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><code> sh_link </code></TD>
<TD><code> .symtab </code> section index </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><code> sh_info </code></TD>
<TD> symbol index </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><code> sh_flags </code></TD>
<TD> none </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><code> sh_entsize </code></TD>
<TD> size of section indices (<code>4</code>) </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> requirements </TD>
<TD> may not be stripped </TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<p>
The section group's <code> sh_link </code> field identifies a symbol
table section, and its <code> sh_info </code> field the index of a
symbol in that section.
The name of that symbol is treated as the identifier of the section group.

<p>
The section data of a SHT_GROUP section is a flag word
followed by a sequence of section indices.
The flag word may contain the following flags:

<dl>
<dt> GRP_COMDAT (0x1)
<dd>
This is a COMDAT group.
It may duplicate another COMDAT group in another object file,
where duplication is defined as having the same identifying symbol name.
In such cases, only one of the duplicate groups should be retained by
the linker, and the remaining groups should be discarded.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The section indices in the SHT_GROUP section identify
the sections which make up the group.

<p>
The <code>sh_size</code> value is <code>sh_entsize</code> times
one plus the number of sections in the group.

<p>
The linker may choose to discard a section in a group,
i.e. not include its data in the linked object,
based on COMDAT duplicate semantics (above),
or for other implementation-defined reasons
(e.g. removing unreferenced code).
If it does so, the group semantics requires that all of the group
members be removed as a unit.

<p>
<i>
(Note, however, that this is not intended to imply that special-case
behavior like removing debug information requires removing the sections
to which it refers, even if they are in a group.
We could clarify this issue by tying the removal semantics to the
section which contains the identifying symbol,
but this seems overly restrictive and unnecessary.
</i>

<p>
<h4> Requirements </h4>

<ul>
<p>
<li>
References to the sections comprising a group,
from sections outside the group,
must be made via global UNDEF symbols,
referencing global symbols defined as addresses in the group sections.
They may not reference local symbols for addresses in the group's
sections, including section symbols.

<p>
<li>
There may not be non-symbol references to the sections comprising a
COMDAT group from sections outside the group, e.g. in sh_link fields.
For example, relocations of one of the group's sections must be in a
relocation section which is also part of the group.

<p>
The above rules allow a group to be removed without leaving
dangling references, with only minimal processing of the symbol table.

<p>
<li>
An entry in a symbol table section not in the group,
with a definition that is relative to one of the group's sections,
should be removed if the group is discarded.

<p>
<li>
The SHT_GROUP section must precede the sections in the group
(in the section table).

</ul>

<p>
<h4> Questions </h4>
<i>

<ul>

<p>
<li>
Do we want flags to specify checking prior to removal of duplicates,
e.g. for identical sections, same defined global symbols, etc.?
If so, should there be one flags word per section index,
instead of per group?
<dd>
Answer:  No flags besides GRP_COMDAT.  Only one flags word needed.
</dd>

<p>
<li>
Do we want more control over when global symbols are removed vs. being
converted to UNDEF?
Alternatively, should we simply require that all symbols defined as
addresses in the group be removed,
and that references to them from outside do so via distinct UNDEF
global symbols?
<dd>
Answer:  Just remove symbols defined relative to removed sections.
</dd>

<p>
<li>
Do we want to replace the symbol rule by simply requiring that any
symbols defined as addresses in the group be defined in a .symtab
section that is itself in the group?
<dd>
Answer:  No.  Removing symbols is not hard, and is already done in
other circumstances in many implementations.
</dd>

<p>
<li>
Why use a symbol to identify a (COMDAT) group instead of the group
section name?
<dd>
Answer:  These will be very common in C++,
and the typical names in C++ can be extremely long
(for template instantiations often multiple kilobytes in current
implementations, and probably 100+ characters on average even if better
mangling is adopted).
Virtually all such sections must already define a real global symbol,
and duplicating such long names in the section name string table is
undesirable space overhead.
</dd>

<p>
<li>
What is the name of a group section?
<dd>
Answer:
It is unspecified, because it has no significance to the linker.
It is recommended that it be something like .group,
possibly with a short suffix to distinguish multiple groups in an
object if necessary,
but we place no requirement on the name.
</dd>

<h2> gABI:  Section Indices </h2>

<p>
<h3> Revisions and Status </h3>

<p>
[991007]
Change section/flag names, move ELF header extension to section header 0.

<p>
<h3> Background </h3>

<p>
SGI has long been concerned about the 64K limitation on the number of
sections in an object file.
Although this need not normally be a problem,
there are purposes for which we would like to place distinct functions,
and sometimes data items,
in distinct sections.
When one takes into account associated sections,
e.g. relocation, debug information, etc.,
this leads to a limitation on the order of 16K units,
and threatens to be a problem for some large compilation units such as
machine-generated simulators.

<p>
C++ ABI efforts raise the same issue from another source.
Various C++ structures are emitted under circumstances
where the compiler cannot reliably identify a single compilation unit
in which to emit them.
Examples include common cases like class virtual tables,
out-of-line copies of inline functions,
and template instantiations.
The favored solution is COMDAT sections,
i.e. putting the potentially duplicated items in their own sections,
and allowing the linker to remove the duplicates.
Once again, though, this threatens to be a problem for very large
compilation units.

<p>
The following proposal attempts to remove this limitation.
Obviously, even if the problem is real,
it will actually arise in very few compilation units.
Therefore, the elements of the proposed solution are defined so as to
leave unchanged object files which do not encounter the problem.
We consider this compatibility objective as primary --
much more important than performance or
clean definitions for the problematic object files --
particularly as it should allow vendors to merge the solution into
existing tool chains at convenient times without disrupting existing
programs.

<p>
The range of section indices from 0xff00 (SHN_LORESERVE) to
0xffff (SHN_HIRESERVE) is reserved for special purposes,
and the gABI already forbids real sections with these indices.
Our approach is to deal with situations where section indices cannot
be compatibly expanded to a full 32 bits
by using one of these indices as an escape value indicating that the
actual index will be found elsewhere.

</i>

<p>
<h4> 4.1 Elf Header </h4>
<i>

<p>
The ELF header has two relevant 16-bit fields:
e_shnum contains the section count,
and e_shtrndx the index of a string section.
We modify their descriptions to include an overflow indicator,
and put the actual values in the reserved section header at index 0
if necessary, as follows:
</i>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>ElfXX_Half e_shnum;</code>
<dd>
This member holds the number of entries in the section header table.
Thus the product of <code>e_shentsize</code> and <code>e_shnum</code>
gives the section header table's size in bytes.
If a file has no section header table,
<code>e_shnum</code> holds the value zero.
<p>
If the number of sections is greater than
<code>SHN_LORESERVE</code> (<code>0xff00</code>),
this member has the value <code>SHN_XINDEX</code> (<code>0xffff</code>),
and the actual number of section header table entries is in the member
<code>sh_size</code> of the section header at index 0.
</dd>


<p>
<dt> <code>ElfXX_Half e_shstrndx;</code>
<dd>
This member holds the section header table index of the entry
associated with the section name string table.
If the file has no section name string table,
this member holds the value <code>SHN_UNDEF</code>.
See ``Sections'' and ``String Table'' below for more information.
<p>
If the section name string table index is greater than
<code>SHN_LORESERVE</code> (<code>0xff00</code>),
this member has the value <code>SHN_XINDEX</code> (<code>0xffff</code>),
and the actual index of the section name string table is in the member
<code>sh_link</code> of the section header at index 0.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<h4> 4.2 Sections </h4>
<i>

<p>
We define a new special section index as an escape value for
large section indices, as referenced above:
</i>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>SHN_XINDEX (0xffff)</code>
<dd>
This special section index means, conventionally,
that the actual section index is too large to fit in the field
where it appears,
and is to be found in another location
(specific to the structure where it appears).
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<i>
We note here that the section header contains two fields commonly used
to hold section indices, <code>sh_link</code> and <code>sh_info</code>,
but they are already defined as ElfXX_Word, and require no change.
</i>

<p>
<i>
A new section type is defined:
</i>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX (17)</code>
<dd>
A section of this type is paired with an SHT_SYMTAB section,
if any of the symbols in that section reference a section index
larger than 16 bits.
It contains a table of 32-bit section indices,
one for each symbol in the symbol table section,
in the same order.
<p>
The <code>sh_link</code> field of this section contains the index of the
associated <code>SHT_SYMTAB</code> section.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<i>
A new special section name is defined:
</i>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>.symtab_shndx</code>
<dd>
This section holds a section header index table for an associated
<code>.symtab</code> section.
The section's attributes will include the <code>SHF_ALLOC</code> bit
if the associated <code>.symtab</code> section does;
otherwise, that bit will be off.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
<i>
There is no available field to point from the <code>.symtab</code> section
to its associated <code>.symtab_shndx</code> section,
so we use the <code>sh_link</code> field in the latter to point back.
It is recommended (but not required) that implementations place each
<code>.symtab_shndx</code> section immediately after its associated
<code>.symtab</code> section (in the section header table)
to make it easy for the linker to find.
</i>

<p>
<h4> 4.x Symbol Table </h4>
<i>

<p>
The symbol table is the most problematic.
It has no convenient location for an expanded section index.
Therefore, we propose that the escape value imply redirection to a
separate, parallel table containing full-size section indices.

<p>
Modify the definition of <code>st_shndx</code> as follows:
</i>

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>st_shndx</code>
<dd>
Every symbol table entry is defined in relation to some section.
This member holds the relevant section header table index.
<p>
As the <code>sh_link</code> and <code>sh_info</code> interpretation
table and the related text describe,
section indexes in the range 0xff00 to 0xffff indicate special meanings.
In particular, <code>SHN_XINDEX (0xffff)</code> indicates that the
real index is too large to fit in this field,
and must be found in the associated SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX table (above).
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
If any of the <code>st_shndx</code> fields in a symbol table section
contain the value <code>SHN_XINDEX (0xffff)</code>,
there must be an associated <code>SHT_SYMTAB_SHNDX</code> section,
with a <code>sh_link</code> field containing the index of this
<code>SHT_SYMTAB</code> section.
That section contains an array of 32-bit section indices,
matching the symbol table entries 1-1 in the same order.
Entries corresponding to <code>SHN_XINDEX (0xffff)</code> values of
<code>st_shndx</code> in the symbol table must contain the actual
section header index to be used.
Others should contain either the correct section header index
(i.e. duplicating the value in <code>st_shndx</code>), or zero.

<p>
<i>
The .dynsym section in a linked object is completely analogous to a
.symtab section in a relocatable object,
and could be handled in the same way with the addition of a dynamic tag
to locate it.
We have not specified handling here because we expect the linking process
to remove most of the section duplication process which causes the problem,
e.g. leaving only a small number of .text sections.

</i>


<p>
<h4> Compatibility </h4>

<p>
<i>
There should be no compatibility impact on existing environments,
since only very large section counts require object file changes.
Individual vendors can postpone implementation until convenient,
with no impact on typical programs.

<p>
Note, however, that any ELF consumer applications that are currently
storing section indices as 16-bit values must change.

<b>Summary</b>:
Static objects with dynamic constructors must be constructed at
intialization time.
This is done via the executable object initialization functions that
are identified (in ELF) by the DT_INIT and DT_INITARRAY dynamic tags.
How should the compiler identify the constructors to be called in this way?
One traditional mechanism is to put calls in a .init section.
Another, used by HP, is to put function addresses in a .initarray section.
<p>
The dual question arises for static object destructors.
Again, the extant mechanisms include putting calls in a .fini section,
or putting function addresses in a .finiarray section.
<p>
Finally, which mechanism (DT_INIT or DT_INITARRAY, or the FINI versions)
should be used in linked objects?
The gABI, and the IA-64 psABI, will support both,
with DT_INIT being executed before the DT_INITARRAY elements.

<b>Summary</b>:
Given that the compiler has identified constructor/destructor calls for
static objects in each relocatable object, in what order should the
static linker combine them in the linked executable object?
(The initialization order determines the finalization order,
as its opposite.)
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990610 All]</font>
Meeting concensus is that the desirable order is right to left on the
link command line, i.e. last listed relocatable object is initialized
first.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990701 SGI]</font>
We propose that global constructors be handled as follows:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The compiler shall emit global constructor calls as one or more entries
in an SHF_INIT_ARRAY section.
<p>
<li>
The linker shall combine them according to the rules of the base gABI,
namely as a concatenated array of entries, in link argument order,
pointed to by a DT_INIT_ARRAY tag.
(The linker may intersperse entries from command line flags or modules
from other languages, but that is beyond the C++ ABI scope.)
</ul>

<p>
This does not address the global destructor problem.
That solution needs to deal not only with the global objects seen by
the compiler, but also interspersed local static objects.
This treatment seems to be tied up in the question of how early
unloading of DSOs is handled, and the data structure used for that
purpose (issue C-3).

<p>
<font color=blue>[990715 All]</font>
Cygnus scheme:
priorities are 16-bit unsigned integers, lower numbers are higher priority.
In each translation unit,
there's a single initialization function for each priority.
Anything that's prioritized has a higher priority than anything that
isn't explicitly assigned a priority.

<p>
IBM scheme:
priorities are 32-bit signed integers, higher numbers are higher priority.
Something that isn't explicitly assigned a priority effectively
gets a priority of 0.

<p>
Consensus:
nobody is sure that negative priorities are very important,
but also nobody can think of a reason not to allow them.
We accept the idea that priorities are 32-bit signed integers.
On a source level Cygnus will keep lower numbers as higher priority,
but that's a source issue, not an ABI issue.

<p>
Status: No real technical issues,
we have consensus on everything that matters.
We need to write up the finicky details.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990722 all]</font>
It was decided to follow the IBM approach, including:
<ul>
<li> The source pragma will use a 32-bit signed priority.
	The default will map to 0,
	and larger numbers are lower priority.

<li> Priorities MIN_INT .. MIN_INT+1023 are reserved to the implementation.

<li> The object representation will use a 32-bit unsigned priority,
	obtained from the source priority by subtracting INT_MIN.

<li> Initialization priorities are only relevant within a DSO.
	Between DSOs, the normal ELF ordering based on object order applies.

</ul>

<p>
To be resolved are the precise source pragma definition (possibly IBM's),
and the ELF file representation.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990729 all]</font>
SGI suggested an object representation involving (in relocatables)
a new section type, containing pairs &lt;priority, entry address>.
The linker would merge all such sections,
include any initialization entries specified by other means,
and leave one or more DT_INITARRAY entries for normal runtime
initialization, either building a routine to call the entries,
or referencing a standard runtime routine.

<p>
IBM noted that they combine their equivalent data structures in the
linker, but don't sort them, leaving that to a runtime routine.
This can be done without explicit linker support,
but involves runtime overhead.

<p>
Cygnus suggested that if we are going to require linker sorting,
we should make the facility more general.

<p>
Jim will write up a more precise proposal.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990804 SGI -- Jim]</font>
<h4> Proposal </h4>

<p>
My objectives are:
<ul>
<li> Simple representation in relocatable objects.
<li> No new representation in executable objects.
<li> Simple static linker processing (general if possible).
<li> Minimal unnecessary runtime cost.
<li> Minimal library interface.
<li> Integration with other initialization (at source priority zero).
</ul>

<p>
<h5> Object File Representation </h5>

<p>
Define a new section type, e.g. <code><b>SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT</b></code>.
Its elements are structs:
<code><pre>
	typedef struct {
	  ElfXX_Word	pi_pri;
	  ElfXX_Addr	pi_addr;
	} ElfXX_Cxx_Priority_Init;
</pre></code>
The semantics are that <code>pi_addr</code> is a function pointer,
with an <code>unsigned int</code> priority parameter,
which performs some initialization at priority <code>pi_pri</code>.
Each of these functions will be called with the GP of the
executable object containing the table.
The section header field <code>sh_entsize</code> is 8 for ELF-32,
or 16 for ELF-64.

<p>
<h5> Runtime Library Support </h5>

<p>
Each implementation shall provide a runtime library function with
prototype:
<code><center>
void __cxx_priority_init ( ElfXX_Cxx_Priority_Init *pi, int cnt );
</center></code>
It will be called with the address of a <code>cnt</code>-element
(sub-)vector of the priority initialization entries,
and will call each of them in order.
It will be called with the GP of the initialization entries.

<p>
<h5> Linker Processing </h5>

<p>
The linker must take the collection of SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT section
entries from the relocatable object files being linked,
and other initialization tasks specified in other ways
(and treated as source priority 0 or object priority -MIN_INT),
and produce an executable object file which executes the initialization
tasks in priority order using only <code>DT_INIT</code>,
<code>DT_INIT_ARRAY</code>, and <code>__cxx_priority_init</code>.
Priority order is first according to the priority of the task,
and then according to the order of relocatable objects and options
in the link command.
The order of tasks specified by other methods,
relative to SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT tasks of priority zero,
is implementation defined.
There are several possible implementations.  Two extremes are:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
The linker sorts the SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT sections together.
If it inserts entries for initialization tasks specified in other ways,
it may make a single DT_INIT_ARRAY entry pointing to __cxx_priority_init.
If not, it must break it into subranges,
interspersing DT_INIT_ARRAY entries for the other tasks with entries
for the SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT entries.
(This implementation will minimize runtime overhead.)

<p>
<li>
The linker simply appends the SHT_CXX_PRIORITY_INIT sections.
It inserts DT_INIT_ARRAY entries before and after the entries for other
initialization tasks which sort this vector and then execute the
negative-priority calls on the first call,
and the positive-priority ones on the second call.
(I believe this is much like today's IBM implementation.)
However, to be conforming, the routine which performs these tasks
must be linked with the resulting executable object,
or shippable with it as an associated DSO.

</ul>

<p>
Note that if one is linking ELF-32 objects into a 64-bit program,
the entries must be expanded as part of this process.

<p>
<h5> Sorting Sections </h5>

<p>
Jason suggested that if we base this feature on sorting sections,
we should provide a general mechanism.
Following is a proposal for that purpose.

<p>
Define a new section header flag, <code>SHF_SORT</code>.
If present, the linker is required to sort the elements of the
concatenated sections of the same type,
where the elements are determined by <code>sh_entsize</code>.
The sort is controlled by fields in <code>sh_info</code>:

<dl>
<p>
<dt> <code>#define SH_INFO_KEYSIZE(info) (info & 0xff)</code>
<br><dd>	The size of the sort key (bytes).
<p>
<dt> <code>#define SH_INFO_KEYSTART(info) ((info>>8) & 0xff)</code>
<br><dd>	The start byte of the sort key within element, from 0.
<p>
<dt> <code>#define SH_INFO_SORTKIND(info) ((info>>16) & 0xf)</code>
<br><dd>	The kind of sort data:
		0 for unsigned integer, 1 for signed integer.

</dl>

<p>
The sort must be stable.
The sort key must be naturally aligned.

<p>
Other conceivable options would be to allow sorting strings
(like SHF_MERGE, this would be indicated by setting SHF_STRING
and putting the character size in <code>sh_entsize</code>),
or floating point data.
Also, note that if we don't anticipate using such a general mechanism,
it becomes possible to avoid padding words in the ELF-64 format by
separating the priority and address vectors.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990810 HU-B -- Martin]</font>
Global destructor ordering must not only interleave with static locals,
but also with atexit.
This gives two problems:
atexit is only guaranteed to support 32 functions;
and dynamic unloading of DSOs break when functions are atexit registered.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990810 SGI -- Matt]</font>
Yes, the interleaving is required by the C++ standard.
It's a nuisance, and I don't think there's any good reason for it,
but the requirement is quite explicit.

<p>
The relevant part of the C++ standard is section 3.6.3, paragraph 3:

<p>
<dl><dd>
<cite>
"If a function is registered with atexit (see <cstdlib>, 18.3) then
following the call to exit, any objects with static storage duration
initialized prior to the registration of that function shall not be
destroyed until the registered function is called from the termination
process and has completed. For an object with static storage duration
constructed after a function is registered with atexit, then following
the call to exit, the registered function is not called until the
execution of the object's destructor has completed. If atexit is called
during the construction of an object, the complete object to which it
belongs shall be destroyed before the registered function is called."
</cite>
</dd></dl>

<p>
What this implies to me is that atexit, and the part of the runtime
library that handles destructors for static objects, must know about
each other.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990812 All]</font>
Some people would prefer a sorting scheme based on the section name
instead of the data, and also less linker impact.
Jim will look into alternatives.

<b>Summary</b>:
Given the constructor/destructor calls for each executable object
comprising a program, what is the order of execution between objects?
For constructors, there is not much question:
unless we choose some explicit means of control,
file-scope objects will be initialized by the DT_INIT/DT_INITARRAY
functions in the order determined by the base ABI order rules,
and local objects will be initialized in the order their containing
scopes are entered.
<p>
For destructors, the Standard requires opposite-order destruction,
which implies a runtime structure to keep track of the order.
Furthermore, the potential for dynamic unloading of a DSO
(e.g. by dlclose)
requires a mechanism for early destruction of a subset.
</td> </tr>

<font color=blue><hr><p>[990804 SGI -- Jim]</font>
<h4> Proposal </h4>

<p>
My objectives are:
<ul>
<li> Simple library interface.
<li> Efficient handling during construction.
<li> Standard-conforming treatment during normal program exit.
<li> Reasonable treatment during early DSO unload (e.g. dlclose).
<li> Minimal dynamic and static linker impact.
</ul>

<p>
<h5> Runtime Data Structure </h5>

<p>
The runtime library shall maintain a list of termination functions
with the following information about each:

<ul>
<li> A function pointer (a pointer to a function descriptor on IA-64).
<li> A void* operand to be passed to the function.
<li> A void* handle for the <i>home DSO</i> of the entry (below).
</ul>

<p>
The representation of this structure is implementation defined.
All references are via the API described below.

<p>
<h5> Runtime API </h5>

<ol type=A>
<p>
<li> Object construction:
<p>
When a global or local static object is constructed,
which will require destruction on exit,
a termination function is <i>registered</i> as follows:
<center><code>
int __cxx_atexit ( void (*f)(void *), void *p, dso_handle d );
</code></center>
This registration, e.g. <code>__cxx_atexit(f,p,d)</code>,
is intended to cause the call <code>f(p)</code> when DSO d is unloaded,
before all such termination calls registered before this one.
It returns zero if registration is successful, nonzero on failure.
<font color=red>Should we use exceptions instead?</font>

<p>
The registration function is called separate from the constructor.

<p>
<li> User atexit calls:
<p>
When the user registers exit functions with <code>atexit</code>,
they should be registered with NULL parameter and DSO handle, i.e.
<center><code>
__cxx_atexit ( f, NULL, NULL );
</code></center>
<font color=red>
Should we also allow user registration with a parameter?
With a home DSO?
</font>

<p>
<li> Termination:
<p>
When linking any DSO containing a call to <code>__cxx_atexit</code>,
the linker should define a hidden symbol <code>__dso_handle</code>,
with a value which is an address in one of the object's segments.
(It doesn't matter what address,
as long as they are different in different DSOs.)
It should also include a call to the following function in the FINI
list (to be executed first):
<center><code>
void __cxx_finalize ( dso_handle d );
</code></center>
The parameter passed should be <code>__dso_handle</code>.

<p>
Note that the above can be accomplished either by explicitly providing
the symbol and call in the linker, or by implicitly including a
relocatable object in the link with the necessary definitions,
using a .fini_array section for the FINI call.
Also, note that these can be omitted for an object with no calls to
<code>__cxx_atexit</code>, but they can be safely included in all objects.

<p>
Finally, a main program should be linked with a FINI call to
<code>__cxx_finalize</code> with NULL parameter.

<p>
When <code>__cxx_finalize(d)</code> is called,
it should walk the termination function list,
calling each in turn if <code>d</code> matches
<code>__dso_handle</code> for the termination function entry.
If <code>d == NULL</code>, it should call all of them.
Multiple calls to <code>__cxx_finalize</code> should not result in
calling termination function entries multiple times;
the implementation may either remove entries or mark them finished.

<p>
<font color=red>
Issue: By passing a NULL-terminated vector of DSO handles to
<code>__cxx_finalize</code> instead of one,
we could deal with unloading multiple DSOs at once.
However, <code>dlclose</code> closes one at a time,
so I'm not sure the extra complexity is worthwhile.
</font>

</ol>

<p>
Since <code>__cxx_atexit</code> and <code>__cxx_finalize</code>
must both manipulate the same termination function list,
they must be defined in the implementation's C++ runtime library,
rather than in the individual linked objects.

Some implementations combine destructors with deletion,
checking a flag in the destructor to determine whether to delete.
This produces somewhat less code,
especially if there are many delete() calls.
However, it adds overhead to any destructor which does not require
deletion, e.g. base and member objects, automatic objects.
There is some concern that a runtime test is sometimes required,
but noone has yet identified why.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990819 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
The [above] questions the usefulness of calling op delete from the destructor.
But it's required by the language,
in case the derived class defines its own op delete.
This only applies to virtual dtors, of course.

<p>
One option would be to have two dtor slots, one which performs deletion
and one which doesn't.
The advantage of this sort of approach would be avoiding pulling in all
the memory management code if you never actually touch the heap.

<p>
Microsoft has a patent on this device,
but the old Sun ABI also talks about it,
which seems to qualify as prior art.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991014 all]</font>
One solution to the problem with destructors is to have
two destructor entry points, and two destructor slots in the vtable.
One entry point destroys the object and then calls operator delete,
the other destroys the object without calling operator delete.
We can use a similar solution for constructors
(but without any impact on the vtable layout):
one entry point for constructing a complete object,
another for constructing a subobject.

<p>
Note that one of the entry points may call the other, but that's not
an ABI issue and can be left to individual implementors.

<p>
There was general agreement that this is a promising idea.
We don't have a detailed proposal yet.
HP is working on a prototype implementation.
Christophe will submit a writeup.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[991028 all]</font>
There are two options in destructors:
<ul>
<li> Whether or not <code>delete()</code> is called.
<li> Whether or not the destructor is <i>in-charge</i>,
     i.e. calls the destructor for virtual bases.
</ul>
Since only the most-derived object calls <code>delete()</code>,
and only the most-derived object does destruction for virtual bases,
only three of the possible combinations arise:
<ul>
<li> No <code>delete()</code>, not in-charge.
<li> No <code>delete()</code>, in-charge.
<li> Call <code>delete()</code>, in-charge.
</ul>
The first will be called for a base object when a derived object is
being destroyed,
and one of the other two for the most-derived object.
Therefore, for any particular vtable,
no more than two will be required.
A vtable for a class with virtual destructors will contain two
destructor entries, delete and no-delete,
and they will both be the in-charge versions for the most-derived class
in the structure.
The no-delete, not in-charge destructors may be called from those,
but always directly,
so a global name is required but no vtable entry.

<p>
We distinguish the delete/no-delete cases by distinct entrypoints,
so only a <code>this</code> parameter is required,
and the standard calling conventions are used.
The only special treatment of virtual destructors is the pair of vtable
entries described above.

We will produce two constructor entries,
one in-charge (constructing virtual bases) for a most-derived object,
and one not in-charge for a base subobject.
The object allocation will be the responsibility of the caller,
so there will be no variation or parameters for that purpose.

For value parameter types with non-trivial constructors or destructor,
a call handles the parameter as follows:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Space is allocated in the caller for the temporary.
If there is no non-trivial constructor,
it is in the normal parameter-passing space (registers/stack);
otherwise it is allocated on the stack or heap.

<p>
<li>
The caller constructs the parameter in the space allocated,
a simple copy to parameter space if there is no non-trivial constructor.

<p>
<li>
The function is called, passing the parameter value
(if no non-trivial constructor),
or its address (if there is a non-trivial constructor).

<p>
<li>
The callee calls any non-trivial destructor for the parameter before
returning.
(Note that, if there is no non-trivial constructor,
this implies that the parameter was copied out of registers on
entry so the destructor can be called with <code>this</code> in memory.)

<p>
<li>
If necessary (e.g. if the parameter was allocated on the heap),
the caller deallocates space after the return.

<h3> Exception Handling Issues </h3>

<p>
For reference, we have design information as follows:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
<font color=blue>[990818 Intel -- Priti]</font>
<a href=Intel-exception-990818.ppt> (PowerPoint document) </a>

<p>
<li>
<font color=blue>[990818 HP -- Christophe]</font>
<a href=HP-exception-990818.pdf> (PDF document) </a>

</ul>

<p>
<font color=blue>[990902 All]</font>
We observed that there are three levels at which we can discuss EH
compatibility.

<p>
The first, minimal level is effectively that of the definition in the
IA-64 Software Conventions document.
It describes a framework which can be used by an arbitrary implementation,
with a complete definition of the stack unwind mechanism,
but no significant constraints on the language-specific processing.
In particular, it is not sufficient to guarantee that two object files
compiled by different C++ compilers could interoperate,
e.g. throwing an exception in one of them and catching it in the other.

<p>
The second level is the minimum that must be specified to allow
interoperability in the sense described above.
This level requires agreement on:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
Standard runtime initialization,
e.g. pre-allocation of space for out-of-memory exceptions.

<p>
<li>
The layout of the exception object created by a throw and processed by
a catch clause.

<p>
<li>
When and how the exception object is allocated and destroyed.

<p>
<li>
The API of the personality routine,
i.e. the parameters passed to it,
the logical actions it performs,
and any results it returns
(either function results to indicate success, failure, or continue,
or changes in global or exception object state),
for both the phase 1 handler search and the phase 2 cleanup/unwind.

<p>
<li>
How control is ultimately transferred back to the user program at a
catch clause or other resumption point.
That is, will the last personality routine transfer control directly to
the user code resumption point,
or will it return information to the runtime allowing the latter to do so?

<p>
<li>
Standard runtime initialization,
e.g. pre-allocation of space for out-of-memory exceptions.

<p>
<li>
Multithreading behavior.

</ul>

<p>
The third level is a specification sufficient to allow all compliant
systems to share the relevant runtime implementation.
It includes, in addition to the above:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
Format of the C++ language-specific unwind tables.

<p>
<li>
APIs of the functions named __allocate_exception, __throw, and
__free_exception (and likely others) by HP, or their equivalents.

<p>
<li>
API of landing pad code,
and of any other entries back into the user code.

<p>
<li>
Definition of what HP calls the exception class value.

</ul>

<p>
The vocal attendees at the meeting wish to achieve the third level,
and we will attempt to do so.
Whether or not that is achieved, however,
a second-level specification must be part of the ABI.

<p>
<li>
<font color=blue>[990909 All/Jim]</font>
With much further discussion,
we are starting to get better understanding of one another,
but there are still obviously (in my mind)
mismatched underlying assumptions.
To resolve this, Christophe agreed to attempt to get us the
HP APIs for the exception handling routines.
I have also started a
<a href=abi-eh.html>document</a> on a more complete EH specification,
though it hasn't gone beyond specifying more of the underlying base ABI part.
I will go farther once I get back from my trip.

<P>Here is a quick description of the personality routine interface

personality routine implemented by HP for IA64. The extension is to

proposal.
Several changes came up, ranging from editorial to substantive.
Christophe will modify the specification.

<ul>
<p>
<li>
Use <i>doubleword</i> instead of <i>word</i> for 8-byte items.

<p>
<li>
By the time the personality routine is called,
the runtime either knows where the language-specific data area is,
or can get it trivially.
Therefore, pass it to the personality routine,
instead of providing _Unwind_getLanguageSpecificData.

<p>
<li>
Most references to <code>setjmp</code> in the document should be to
<code>longjmp</code>.

<p>
<li>
The description of EH_DELETE_EXCEPTION_OBJECT was unclear.

<p>
<li>
Clarify the distinction between passes 1 and 2, and the final steps
(which are generally referred to as pass 2).

<p>
<li>
The group agreed that the performance benefit of allowing a simplified
setjmp which supports only a full-unwinding longjmp
is outweighed by the interoperability benefit of having a single setjmp
which will support either a C-style direct or a C++ full-unwind longjmp.

<p>
<li>
We will follow the lead of IBM (?) and specify a distinct longjmp call
which is defined to do a full-unwind longjmp.

<p>
<li>
Pthreads cancellation will be supported by specifying:
  <ul>
  <li> New exceptions (cancel and exit).
  <li> catch(...) always rethrows.
  <li> catch(...) catches anything, including foreign languages.
  </ul>

</ul>

<b>Summary</b>:
The IA-64 runtime conventions describe language-independent descriptors
for restoring registers when unwinding the stack.
The do not specify how C++ performs language-specific unwinding for
exception handling, i.e. locating a handler and destroying automatic
objects.

The languge-specific part of the EH stack in g++ contains these
elements:

<p>
<code><pre>
void *value; // pointer to the thrown object, or the thrown value
             // itself if a pointer
void *type;  // pointer to the type_info node for the thrown object
void (*cleanup)(void *, int) // pointer to the dtor for the object
bool caught; // has this exception been caught since its last throw?
long handlers; // how many catch handlers are active for this exception
</code></pre>

<p>
Both 'caught' and 'handlers' are needed to handle rethrowing and
catching within a catch block.

<p>
Language interaction is handled by recording the language of both the
exception region and the thrown exception.  Each thrown exception also
includes a pointer to a language-specific matching function which is
called to compare the types of the exception and handler.

Discussion reveals that Intel and HP have very different models of how
cleanup actions are handled.

<p>
Intel builds one or more routines which are called from the unwind runtime,
based on action descriptors in the unwind tables,
and acting on the stack contents or objects to be destroyed
without actually modifying the stack pointer until the final transfer
of control to the user handler.
This approach avoids actually restoring registers until the final
transfer to the handler.

<p>
HP transfers control back to a user landing pad whenever anything needs
to be done -- descriptors or handlers --
and reenters the unwind runtime if further processing is required.
They believe this approach to use much less space than the action
descriptors would,
and most importantly,
that it allows arbitrary fixup for code motion around the call that throws.

Moot -- resume-type exceptions are more appropriately handled by

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Jim]</font>
The typical case of cleanup and resume is floating point trap handling,
which is normally handled entirely in the original FP trap handler.
Is there an example where stack walkback must occur to identify the
handler, but resumption at the point-of-exception is required?
I can't think of any, and I think the model of registering a trap
handler is preferable for such purposes.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 IBM -- Mendell]</font>
Does longjmp run destructors?
I believe that the C ABI makes this optional.
I would like to propose that it does run destructors.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Wilkinson]</font>
The C++ standard, 18.7 paragraph 4,
says a call to longjmp has undefined behavior if any automatic objects
would have been destroyed by a
throw/catch with the same source and destination.
I don't see that this is something we need to fix.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 IBM -- Thomson]</font>
Yes it does, but ANSI is not my customer.
Meeting the bare minimum of function that ANSI requires
doesn't necessarily mean that users can build robust applications.
How can they know to avoid longjmp in their C code,
because some third party library they are using has C++ buried in it?

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Dehnert]</font>
Implementation is a significant issue.
The normal longjmp implementation is very simple --
setjmp stores the register/stack state,
and longjmp copies it back and branches.
There is normally no traceback involved,
so what you suggest is a dramatic change,
and probably would make C people very unhappy.
Furthermore, C++ users have the option of using C++ exceptions,
which have the effect you seek.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 SGI -- Boehm]</font>
The problem is that on the C side:

<ol>
<p>
<li>A number of thread packages use setjmp/longjmp to perform context switches.
    In this case,
    the target sp is not on the same stack as the original sp,
    and there should not be any destructor invocations,
    since the original thread will be resumed,
    and the original sp will eventually be restored.
    (This isn't the optimal way to do thread switching,
    but it's the only one that's semi-portable,
    and hence it's moderately common.)

<p>
<li>Some variants of longjmp are often used to jump out of signal handlers,
    which may not be invoked on the original user stack
    (cf. sigaltstack on most Unix systems).
    Thus unwinding may have to cross stack boundaries.

<p>
<li>Setjmp is often used to capture the register state,
    e.g. for garbage collectors.
    (The collector I'm responsible for optionally does this.
    Last I looked, Guile did it unconditionally.)
    A straightforward stack-unwinding implementation of setjmp/longjmp
    would break this.
</ol>

<p>
I don't know whether it's possible to avoid breaking these clients
while providing the stack-unwinding semantics.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990908 IBM -- Mendell/Thomson]</font>
[VisualAge C++] on OS/2 and Windows does do the unwinding.
This is probably because unwinding support is in the OS.
Also OS/390 and I believe AS/400 too.
Our AIX implementation does not do the unwinding.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990909 DEC -- Brender]</font>
In addition to the systems already mentioned by
others, these systems also do exception-handling compatible unwinding
for C's setjmp/longjmp:

<ul>
<li> VMS/VAX and VMS/Alpha:
    Tru64 Unix/Alpha [not originally, but at least as of V4]
<li>
    Microsoft Visual C on W95&WNT/IA32:
       [to support SEH (structured exception handling) extensions]
	(probably also on IA64 for compatibility reasons)
<li>
    Microsoft Visual C on WNT/Alpha (RIP):
       [to support SEH]
</ul>

<p>
If you believe in safe and compatible multi-language systems,
there really is no choice but to do EH compatible unwinding for
setjmp/longjmp -- at least by default.

<p>
I suppose it would be OK for an implementation to offer an alternate
setjmp/longjmp that could be linked in for those who either know that
it is safe in particular cases or are happy to trade safety for speed...

<p>
<font color=blue>[990909 All]</font>
A brief discussion agreed that concensus is not absolutely necessary.
An implementation could replace setjmp/longjmp with a version that
either unwinds or justs restores and jumps,
without breaking any code except that which assumed one or the other.
(Ed.:  In fact, if setjmp stores enough information to either restore
or to catch an exception, one could just swap longjmp,
although that would not be optimal for the unwind and catch case,
since setjmp doesn't need to save much information in that case
as most of what is needed is in the unwind descriptors.)

<p>
<font color=blue>[990923 All]</font>
We agreed that:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
We will use a single setjmp which retains enough information for a
traditional C direct longjmp.

<p>
<li>
We will define a new longjmp call which always does full unwinding.

<p>
<li>
Implementations may implement longjmp as either the direct or the
full-unwind form, as a default, or using a user option.

<p>
<li>
catch(...) will catch all exceptions, including foreign-language ones.
It will always rethrow.
</ul>

<h3> Name Mangling Issues </h3>

What rules shall be used for mangling names,

</td> </tr>

<p>
<font color=blue>[991019/28 various]</font>
The following is assembled from several mail messages on the subject.

<p>
<h5> Objectives of the mangling scheme include:</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
Compression:  It is critical that name length be minimized (issue F-2).

<p>
<li>
Character set:  Names should use a character set that does not cause
problems in linkers (easy for Elf) or in assemblers (more problematic).
This probably implies use of ~64 characters.

<p>
<li>
Legibility:  It is desirable that the base name (i.e. the function or
class name) be present and easy to identify (for readability).
Other components of the name probably need to be difficult in order to
attain compression (issue F-2).

<p>
<li>
Cfront:  It is desirable that the names <b>not</b> be confusable with
cfront manglings, to avoid apparent but incomplete compatibility with
cfront-compiled objects.

</ul>

<p>
<h5> Entities with linkable names to be resolved include:</h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Global and member operator names
<li> Global and member function names
<li> Namespace scope variables
<li> Static local variables
<li> Static data members
<li> Virtual function table names (primary and initialization)
<li> RTTI structures (std::type_info derivations)
<li> Template instances of the above
<li> Namespace effects on the above (including anonymous namespaces)
<li> Possibly exception handling structures
<li> Possibly string constants
</ul>

<p>
For entities with C name linkage,
the entity's linkable name is identical to its base name (as usual).

<p>
Note that linkable names include not only names with
C++ global scope semantics,
but also "local" names which for some reason end up
requiring linker resolution
(e.g. static local variables declared in inline functions).
Note also that inlining requirements apply equally to functions
declared inline and those chosen to be inlined by the compiler.

<p>
<h5> Name decomposition for function-like entities:</h5>
<p>
For function-like entities with C++ name linkage,
the following components MUST be part of the of the name:
<ul>
<li> encoding of the base name (presumably, the base name itself)
<li> encoding of the declarative scope (classes and namespaces),
    when applicable
<li> encoding of each parameter type (with known positions)
<li> encoding of each template argument
    and the parameter with which it is associated, when applicable
</ul>

<p>
[ For the last item, consider: <code>
<pre>    template<typename T1, typename T2> void f(T1, T2);
    template<typename T1, typename T2> void f(T2, T1);
</pre></code>
The encoding of each of these templates instantiated for <char, char>
should be distinct. ]

<p>
In addition, it may be desirable to encode the following components:
<ul>
<li> the function's return type
<li> the function's exception specifications
</ul>
(Combined with the parameter types,
this encodes the type of the function.
Note that even though exception specifications are not
considered part of the function type in the C++ standard;
they actually are.)

<p>
<h5> Name decomposition for data entities:</h5>
<p>
Namespace scope variables and static data members have
linkable names that must include at least:
<ul>
<li> encoding of the base name (presumably, the base name itself)
<li> encoding of the declarative scope (classes and namespaces),
    when applicable
</ul>

In addition, it may be desirable to encode:
<ul>
<li> the variable's type (possibly including exception specifications)
</ul>
<p>
Note that although there are benefits to encoding array size,
and therefore being able to catch mismatches,
the ability to declare <code>a[]</code> makes this problematic.

<p>
<h5> Fundamental types and type operators:</h5>

<p>
fundamental types:
<ul>
<li> void
<li> [signed|unsigned] {
<li> char, short, int, long} (long long?, int<n>_t)
<li> bool
<li> float, double, (long double?)
<li> wchar_t
<li> ellipsis (not strictly a type)
<li> complex
</ul>

<p>
type modifiers/constructors:
<ul>
<li> const, volatile (restrict?)
<li> array (with size?) of type
<li> pointer to type
<li> reference to type
<li> function expecting type*, returning type
<li> pointer to member function of type, expecting type*, returning type
<li> pointer to member of type T, having type U (i.e. "U T::*")
</ul>

<p>
The types in parentheses are available in C99,
but not in standard C++.


<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[991021 all]</font>
It was observed in the meeting that it might be better to deal with
non-essential type information
(e.g. exception specifications, array sizes)
as a separate construct to allow error detection,
rather than as a required part of the mangled name.
This allows it to be elided or removed if unneeded.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991028 all]</font>
Objectives of a specification were discussed,
and have been added to the writeup above.

<b>Summary</b>:
Typical name mangling schemes to date typically begin to produce very
long names.  SGI routinely encounters multi-kilobyte names,
and increasing usage of namespaces and templates will make them worse.
This has a negative impact on object file size, and on linker speed.
<p>
SGI has considered solutions to this problem including modified string
tables and/or symbol tables to eliminate redundancy.
Cygnus, HP, and Sun have also considered or implemented approaches
which at least mitigate it.
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
<font color=blue>[991028 all]</font>
Cygnus and Sun use a mangling scheme which has proven extremely
effective at compression, but not overly complex.
Each time the mangler incorporates a type into a name,
it remembers it and assigns it a number,
and subsequent occurrences of the type in the name are replaced by
the (escaped) number.
Jason believes this might be adequate compression,
without going to large character sets or more complex schemes.

<p>
<font color=blue>[991028 all]</font>
In a number of cases,
the Standard requires consistent definitions in different places,
even in different files,
but does not require the implementation to detect and report
inconsistency.
With a small amount of extra information,
the linker could often detect and report such inconsistencies.
Also, there are cases where the linker can already detect a problem,
but could provide a better diagnostic with more information.

<p>
Several examples are:

<ul>
<p>
<li>
A template instantiation may conflict with a full specialization
(in different translation units).

<p>
<li>
Functions may be declared with different exceptions specifications.

<p>
<li>
Functions may be declared with different return types.

<p>
<li>
Template formal parameter names would help improve instantiation error
messages.

How should we handle local static variables in inlines?
G++ currently avoids this issue by suppressing
inlining of functions with local statics.
If we don't want to do that,
we'll need to specify a mangling for the statics,
and handle multiple copies like we do above.

<p>
<font color=blue>[990721 Cygnus -- Jason]</font>
[We should emit inline routines]
in translation units where an out-of-line copy is needed.
I am opposed to emitting the inlines with the vtable,
for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>
One of our users defines a proxy class whose implementation is not
exported from the shared library where it is defined;
the API for the class consists of virtual functions,
accessible through the vtable, and inline functions.
They complained that since g++ currently emits inlines along with the vtable,
their code would only link if inlining was enabled.
<li>
Often, we will need 0 copies of inline functions.

<b>Summary</b>:
The Standard requires that local static objects with dynamic
constructors be initialized exactly once, the first time the containing
scope is entered.
Multi-threading renders the simple check of a flag before
initialization inadequate to prevent multiple initialization.
Should the ABI require locking for this purpose,
and if so, what are the necessary interfaces?
In addition to the locking of the initialization,
special exception handling treatment is required to deal with an
exception during construction.

The standard is mute on multiple threads of control in general, so 
there is no requirement in the language to support what I'm talking
about. But as a practical matter compilers have to do it (Watcom gave
a paper on their approach during the standardization process, if I
remember).  This example using UI/SVR4 threads will usually show
whether a compiler does it or not: 

<pre><code>
thr5.C:
// static local initialization and threads

#include <stdlib.h>
#define EXIT(a) exit(a)
#define THR_EXIT() thr_exit(0)

#include <thread.h>

int init_count = 0;
int start_count = 0;

int init()
{
  
        ::thr_yield();
        return ++init_count;
}

void* start(void* s)
{
  
        start_count++;
        static int i = init();
        if (i != 1) EXIT(5);
        THR_EXIT();
        return 0;
}
                
int main()
{
  
        thread_t t1, t2;
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t1) != 0) EXIT(1);
        if (::thr_create(0, 0, start, 0, 0L, &t2) != 0) EXIT(2);
        if (::thr_join(t1, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(3);
        if (::thr_join(t2, 0, 0) != 0) EXIT(4);
        if (start_count != 2)
                EXIT(6);
        if (init_count != 1)
                EXIT(7);
        THR_EXIT();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
When compiled with CC -Kthread thr5.C on UnixWare 7, for instance,
it passes by returning 0.  When compiled with CC -mt thr5.C on
Solaris/x86 C++ 4.2 (sorry don't have the latest version!), it
fails by returning 5.

<font color=blue><hr><p>[990607 Sun -- Mike Ball]</font>
As far as I can tell, the language says that the automatic blocking 
issue isn't a valid approach.  It says what has to happen, and
it isn't that.

<p>
If you look at the entire statement you find that it reads:
<quote>
"Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes
through its declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon
the completion of its initialization.
If the initialization exits by throwing an exception,
the initialization is not complete,
so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration.
If control re-enters the declaration (recursively)
while the object is being initialized,
the behavior is undefined."
</quote>

<p>
The word "recursively" is normative,
so eliminates that sentence from consideration.

<p>
One can, of course, make any extension to the language,
but in this case I think the extension invalidates some otherwise valid code.

<p>
The sentence I'm referring to is that the object is considered
initialized upon the completion of its initialization.
This is explicit, and the reason for it is covered in the following sentence,
which discusses an initialization that terminates with an exception.
A person catching such an exception has the right to try again
without danger that the static variable will be initialized in the meantime.

<p>
I don't see anything at all to justify semantics that say,
"after initialization is started, Any other threads of control are
blocked until that thread completes the initialization,
unless, of course, it executes by an exception,
in which case the other thread can do the initialization before the
exception handler gets a chance to try again, except...."
 Take an attempt to define the semantics as far as you like.

<p>
The problem is that there is no way for the compiler writer to know
what the programmer really wanted to do.
I can (and will at some other date, if necessary)
come up with scenarios justifying a variety of mutual exclusion policies,
including none.

<p>
The solution is to let the programmer write the mutual exclusion, the
same as we do for every other potential race condition.
It's a real mess, and, I claim, an unwise one to put in as an extension.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990608 HP -- Christophe]</font>
The semantics currently implemented in the HP aC++ compiler is as follows:
<ul>
<li> No two thread can enter a static initialization at the same time
<li> Threads are blocked until immediately after the static  
    initialization either succeeds or fails with an exception.
</ul>

<p>
There are details of our implementation that I disagree with, but in  
general, the semantics seem clear and sane, not as convoluted as you  
seemed to imply. In particular, it correctly covers the case where  
the static initialization fails with an exception. Any thread at that  
point can attempt the initialization.

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990608 SCO -- Jonathan]</font>
Here's what the SCO UnixWare 7 C++ compiler does for IA-32,
from a (slightly sanitized) design document.
 It meets Jim's goal of having no overhead for non-threaded programs
and minimal overhead for threaded programs unless
actual contention occurs (infrequent),
and meets Mike's goal of handling exceptions in the initialization correctly
(although it doesn't guarantee that the thread getting the exception is
the one that gets next crack at initializing the static).
 It's also worth noting that dynamic initialization of local variables
(static or otherwise) is very common in C++,
since that's what most object constructions involve,
so I don't think this case is as rare as Jim does.


<p>
[...] This is in local static variables with dynamic initialization,
where the compiler generates out a static one-time flag to guard the
initialization.
Two threads could read the flag as zero before either of them set it,
resulting in multiple initializations.

<p>
[...] Accordingly, when compilation is done with -Kthread on,
a code sequence will be generated to lock this initialization.  
[...] the basic idea is to have one guard saying whether the
initialization is done (so that multiple initializations do not occur)
and have another guard saying whether initialization is in progress
(so that a second thread doesn't access what it thinks is
an initialized value before the first thread has finished the
initialization).  [...]

<p>
When compiled with -Kthread, the generated code for a dynamic
initialization of a local static variable will look like the
following. guard is a local static boolean, initialized to zero,
generated by the [middle pass of the compiler]. 
Two bits of it are used: the low-order 'done bit'
and the next-low-order 'busy bit'.

<pre><code>
.again:
        movl    $guard,%eax
        testl   $1,(%eax)       // test the done bit
        jnz     .done           // if set, variable is initialized,
done
        lock; btsl  $1,(%eax)   // test and set the busy bit
        jc      .busy
        < init code >           // not busy, do the initialization
        movl    $guard,%eax
        movl    $3,(%eax)       // set the done bit
        jmp     .done
.busy:
        pushl   %eax            // call RTS routine to wait, passing address
        call1   __static_init_wait      // of guard to monitor
        testl   %eax,%eax       // 1 means exception occurred in init code,
        popl    %ecx
        jnz     .again                  // start the whole thing over
.done                                   // 0 means wait finished
</code></pre>

<p>
The above code will work for position-independent code as well.

The complication due to exceptions is:
what happens if the initialization code throws an exception?
The [compiler] EH tables will have set up a special region and flag in
their region table to detect this situation,
along with a pointer to the guard variable.
Because the initialization never completed,
when the RTS sees that it is cleaning up from such a region,
it will reset the guard variable back to both zeroes.
This will free up a busy-waiting thread, if any,
or will reset everything for the next thread that calls the function.

<p>
The idea of the __static_init_wait() RTS routine is to monitor the
value of guard bits passed in, by looping on this decision table:
<pre><code>
    done    busy
    0       0       return 1 in %eax        (EH wipe-out)
    1       1       return 0 in %eax        (no longer busy)
    0       1       continue to wait        (still busy)
    1       0       internal error, shouldn't happen
</code></pre>

<p>
As for how the wait is done [... not relevant for ABI,
although currently we're using thr_yield(),
which may or may not be right for this context].

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990608 SGI -- Hans]</font>
I'd like to make some claims about function scope static constructor
calls in multithreaded environments.
I personally can't recall ever having used such a construct,
which somewhat substantiates my claims,
but also implies some lack of certainty.
I'd be interested in hearing any arguments to the contrary.

<p>
I believe that these arguments imply that this problem is not important
enough to warrant added ABI complexity or overhead for sequential code.

<p>
Consider the following skeletal example:

<p><code>
f(int x) { static foo a(...); ... }
</code>

<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the constructor argument doesn't depend on the function parameter,
and the code behaves reasonably, it should be possible to rewrite this as

<p><code>
static foo a(...);
<br>
f(int x) { ... }
</code>

<p>
<li>
If I read the standard correctly (and that's a big disclaimer),
the compiler is entitled to perform the above transformation under
conditions that are usually true,
but hard for the compiler to deduce.
Thus code that relies on the initialization occurring during the
execution of f is usually broken.

<p>
<li>
Thus the foo constructor cannot rely on its caller holding any locks.
It must explicitly acquire any locks it needs.

<p>
<li>
It is far preferable to write the transformed form with a file scope
static variable to start with.
The initial form risks deadlock,
since f may be called with locks held which the constructor
can't assume are held.
If it needs one of those locks it will need to reacquire it.
With default mutex semantics that results in deadlock with itself.
(If locks may be reentered,
it may fail in a more subtle manner since the foo constructor may
acquire a monitor lock whose monitor invariant doesn't hold.)

<p>
<li>
File scope static constructor calls aren't a problem and require no locking,
since they are executed in a single thread before main is called or
before dlopen returns.
(Forking a thread in a static constructor should probably be disallowed.
Threads may not have been fully initialized, among other issues.)

<p>
<li>
Static function scope constructor calls which depend on function
arguments are likely to involve a race condition anyway,
if multiple instances of the function can be invoked concurrently.
Any of the calls might determine the constructor parameters.
Thus these aren't very interesting either.
And if they are really needed, they can be replaced with a file scope
static constructor call plus an assignment.

</ol>

<p>
<font color=blue><hr><p>[990607 SCO -- Jonathan]</font>
Hans' argument breaks such local statics into two groups:
those that don't depend upon the function's parameters,
and those that do.
For the latter group, he says:

<pre><i>
> 6) Static function scope constructor calls which depend on function
> arguments are likely to involve a race condition anyway, if multiple
> instances of the function can be invoked concurrently.  Any of the
> calls might determine the constructor parameters.  Thus these aren't
> very interesting either.  And if they are really needed, they can be
> replaced with a file scope static constructor call plus an assignment.
</i></pre>

<p>
I don't agree with these claims.
There are sometimes situations where a group of objects is being processed,
and you want to arbitrarily pick one of them
to serve as an identifier or key for all of them.
 Consider perhaps a golf course scheduler,
which is taking in players and assigning them to foursomes.  
You want to name each foursome by one of the names of the players
(it doesn't matter which one),
such as the "Jones group" or the "Smith group".  
A natural way to program this might be:

<pre><tt>
      void build_foursome(string golfer) {
	  static string group_name(golfer);
	  // process golfer into group group_name ...
      }
</tt></pre>

<p>
Now if the golfers being scheduled are coming from four different databases,
it might be that a thread is running to extract from each database.
Thus build_foursome() might be called concurrently.
That's fine, and there is no need for application-level locks in
either the caller or this function; we don't care which golfer
the group is named after.
We just want the 'static' to work correctly;
what we don't want is a double initialization,
with two different group names being generated for golfers in the same group,
which is possible if the guard code isn't thread-safe.

<p>
Now one can say that this kind of design isn't wise,
or that locks will probably be needed later in this function
to do the rest of the processing, 
or that this can be coded in several other ways.
And that may all be so.
But I think this usage is *reasonable* in this context,
and that as implementors we should get it right.
[Editorial:  Especially with the advent of Java,
threaded application programming is becoming more the norm; 
and language implementations that dodge the challenge and say that
thread support is solely the job of libraries,
may not be looked upon kindly by users.]
