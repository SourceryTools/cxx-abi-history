<h3> Revisions </h3>

<p>
[990616]  Added HP summaries.
Added sketchy notes from 990610 discussions (A and B issues).
A-10 was intended by HP as something different than I described,
so it was renamed, and a new issue A-13 opened as an SGI issue.
HP did not submit A-12, so relabeled as Sun's (is that right?).
Added library interface issues, H-1 and H-2.

<p> <hr> <p>
<h3> Issue Status </h3>

In the following sections,
the <b><i>class</i></b> of an issue attempts to classify it on the
basis of what it likely affects.
The identifiers used are:

<p>
[990610 All]
Given the absence of addressing modes with displacements on IA-64,
the consensus is to answer the first part of this question with "first."

<p>
[990617 All]
Given a Vptr and only non-polymorphic bases,
which (Vptr or base) goes at offset 0?
<ul>
<li> HP: Vptr at end, but IA-64 is different because no load displacement
<li> Sun: Vptr at 0 probably preferred
<li> g++: Vptr at end today
</ul>
<p>
Tentative decision:  Vptr always goes at beginning.
This issue is reduced to the question of Vtable layout.

<b>Summary</b>:
Where are the virtual base subobjects placed in the class layout?
How are data member accesses to them handled?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
[990610 Matt]
With regard to how data member accesses are handled,
the choices are to store either a pointer or an offset in the Vtable.
The concensus seems to be to prefer an offset.

<p>
[990617 All]
Any number of empty virtual base subobjects (rare) will be placed at
offset zero.
If there are no non-virtual polymorphic bases,
the first virtual base subobject with a Vpointer will be placed at
offset zero.
Finally, all other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
Therefore,

<b>Summary</b>:
Define the class layout in the presence of multiple base classes.
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
[990617 All]
At offset zero is the Vptr whenever there is one,
as well as the first non-virtual base class with a Vptr
(or if there is no no-virtual base class with a Vptr,
but there is a virtual base class with a Vptr, it goes at offset zero).
Also at offset zero is any number of empty base classes,
as long as that does not place multiple subobjects of the same type at
the same offset.
If there are multiple empty base classes such that placing two of them
at offset zero would violate this constraint, the first is placed there.
(First means in declaration order.)

<p>
All other non-virtual base classes are laid out in declaration order at
the beginning of the class.
All other virtual base subobjects will be allocated at the
end of the class, left-to-right, depth-first.

<p>
The above ignores issues of padding for alignment,
and possible reordering of class members to fit in padding areas.

</table>

<p>
[990623 SGI]
We propose that no parameter slot be allocated to such parameters,
i.e. that no register be used,
and that no space in the parameter memory sequence be used.
This implies that the callee must allocate storage at a unique address
if the address is taken (which we expect to be rare).

<b>Summary</b>:
The standard constrains ordering of class members in memory only if
they are not separated by an access clause.
Do we use an access clause as an opportunity to fill the gaps left by padding?
</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>
[990610 all]
Some participants want to avoid attempts to reorder members differently
than the underlying C struct ABI rules.
Others think there may be benefit in reordering later access sections
to fill holes in earlier ones, or even in base classes.

<p>
[990617 all]
There are several potential reordering questions, more or less independent:
<ol>
<li> Do we reorder whole access regions relative to one another?
<li> Do we attempt to fill padding in earlier access regions with
	initial members from later regions?
<li> Do we fill the tail padding of non-POD base classes with members from
	the current class?
<li> Do we attempt to fill interior padding of non-POD base classes with later
	members?
</ol>

<p>
There is no apparent support for (1),
since no simple heuristic has been identified with obvious benefits.
There is interest in (2), based on a simple heuristic which might
sometimes help and will never hurt.
However, it is not clear that it will help much,
and Sun objects on grounds that they prefer to match C struct layout.
Unless someone is interested enough to implement and run experiments,
this will be hard to agree upon.
G++ has implemented (3) as an option,
based on specific user complaints.
It clearly helps HP's example of a base class containing a word and flag,
with a derived class adding more flags.
Idea (4) has more problems, including some non-intuitive (to users) layouts,
and possibly complicating the selection of bitwise copy in the compiler.

There are several methods for adjusting the <i>this</i> pointer

including thunks or offsets located in the vtable.
We need to agree on the mechanism used,

To maximize performance on IA64,
a slightly unusual approach such as using secondary entry points
to perform the adjustment may actually prove interesting.

There are several methods for adjusting the 'this' pointer of the

Return thunks might be especially costly on IA64,

<p>
[990610 Matt]
One possibility is to have two Vtable entries,
which might point to different functions, different entrypoints,
or a real entrypoint and a thunk.
Another is to return two result pointers (base/derived),
and have the caller select the right one.

<b>Summary</b>:
The contents of the vtable can sometimes be modified,
but the concensus is that it is nonetheless always allowed to "cache" elements,
i.e. to retain them in registers and reuse them,
whenever it is really useful.
However, this may sometimes break "beyond the standard" code,
such as code loading a shared library that replaces a virtual function.
Can we all agree when caching is allowed?

For a runtime architecture where the caller is expected to load the GP

Another is to include only the address of a thunk which loads the GP
before doing the actual call.

<b>Summary</b>:
Static objects with dynamic constructors must be constructed at
intialization time.
This is done via the executable object initialization functions that
are identified (in ELF) by the DT_INIT and DT_INITARRAY dynamic tags.
How should the compiler identify the constructors to be called in this way?
One traditional mechanism is to put calls in a .init section.
Another, used by HP, is to put function addresses in a .initarray section.
<p>
The dual question arises for static object destructors.
Again, the extant mechanisms include putting calls in a .fini section,
or putting function addresses in a .finiarray section.
<p>
Finally, which mechanism (DT_INIT or DT_INITARRAY, or the FINI versions)
should be used in linked objects?
The gABI, and the IA-64 psABI, will support both,
with DT_INIT being executed before the DT_INITARRAY elements.

</table>

<p>
[990610 All]
Meeting concensus is that the desirable order is right to left on the

<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
Given the constructor/destructor calls for each executable object
comprising a program, what is the order of execution between objects?
For constructors, there is not much question:
unless we choose some explicit means of control,
file-scope objects will be initialized by the DT_INIT/DT_INITARRAY
functions in the order determined by the base ABI order rules,
and local objects will be initialized in the order their containing
scopes are entered.
<p>
For destructors, the Standard requires opposite-order destruction,
which implies a runtime structure to keep track of the order.
Furthermore, the potential for dynamic unloading of a DSO
(e.g. by dlclose)
requires a mechanism for early destruction of a subset.

<b>Summary</b>:
The Standard says that the behavior of anything other than
"pure C code" (POF) is implementation defined,
and warns (in a note) against using EH in a signal handler.
We should define what is supported,
possibly explicitly stating that signal handler code must be a POF.
We could allow any feature but exception handling to be used.
We could allow some EH routines to be called
(for instance, <code>uncaught_exception()</code>).
Or we could allow even an exception to be thrown,
if it does not exit the handler.

<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
There are two principal models for instantiation.
The <i>early instantiation</i> (or Borland) model performs all
instantiation at compile time,
potentially resulting in extra copies which are removed at link time.
The <i>pre-link instantiation</i> model identifies the required
instantiations prior to linking and instantiates them via a special
compile step.

<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
Independent of the template instantiation model,
we need to make sure that whatever template persistent storage is used
by one vendor does not interact negatively with other vendors' mechanisms.
Issues:
  (1) Avoiding conflict on the name of any repository.
  (2) If .o files are used,
	describe how this information is to be preserved, ignored, etc.
  (3) Evaluate if tools such as make, ld, ar, or others, can
	break because .o files get written at unexpected times.

<h3> Name Mangling Issues </h3>

</tr>
<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
Typical name mangling schemes to date typically begin to produce very
long names.  SGI routinely encounters multi-kilobyte names,
and increasing usage of namespaces and templates will make them worse.
This has a negative impact on object file size, and on linker speed.
<p>
SGI has considered solutions to this problem including modified string
tables and/or symbol tables to eliminate redundancy.
Cygnus, HP, and Sun have also considered or implemented approaches
which at least mitigate it.

<b>Summary</b>:
In order to allow detection of conflicting template instantiation

should we name them differently?
If we do so in an easily recognizable way,
the linker could check for conflicts and report the ODR violation.

<tr> <td colspan=7>
<b>Summary</b>:
The Standard requires that local static objects with dynamic
constructors be initialized exactly once, the first time the containing
scope is entered.
Multi-threading renders the simple check of a flag before
initialization inadequate to prevent multiple initialization.
Should the ABI require locking for this purpose,
and if so, what are the necessary interfaces?
In addition to the locking of the initialization,
special exception handling treatment is required to deal with an
exception during construction.
