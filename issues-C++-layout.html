C++ Class layout and member function invocation</h1></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Ordinary class, no inheritance or virtual functions</h2>
Same as in C.&nbsp; An object is a contiguous region of storage; the data
members appear in the order of declaration.&nbsp; (Not quite required by
the C++ standard, but everyone does it that way.)&nbsp; Every object has
nonzero size.&nbsp; Padding is same as in C.
<p>Member function invocation: calling convention for a member function
of class <tt>X</tt> is just the same as for a non-member, except that it
gets an extra argument.&nbsp; This argument comes before all of the ones
<br>that the user declares.&nbsp; For non-<tt>const</tt> member functions
this argument is of type <tt>X*</tt>, and for const member functions it
is of type const <tt>X*</tt>.
<p>Static data members and static member functions are not part of the
class, except for name resolution and access rules.&nbsp; They get mangled
names, but otherwise they are handled just the same way as any ordinary
global variable or global function.

<h2>
Base class(es), no virtual functions</h2>
An object in C++ is a contiguous region of storage, and it's possible to
convert a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to any of its base classes,
so there isn't much choice here: a derived class must have a contiguous
region for each of its base class subobjects, and then a region for all
of its own data members.&nbsp; Issues: what order do the base class subobjects
come in (only matters for multiple inheritance), how do we handle alignment
restrictions, and do we do anything special for empty base classes?
<p>Cfront solution:
<ul>
<li>
Base class subobjects are in order of declaration.&nbsp; That is, if we've
got</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; struct Y : public X1, public X2, public X3 { int n; };</pre>
then, in order of increasing address, we've got an <tt>X1</tt> subobject
starting at the same address as the <tt>Y</tt> object; then an <tt>X2</tt>
subobject; then an <tt>X3</tt> subobject; then an <tt>int</tt>.
<li>
Each of the subobjects has the appropriate padding.&nbsp; There is as much
space reserved for an <tt>X1</tt> subobject in a <tt>Y</tt> as for <tt>sizeof(X1)</tt>,
including <tt>X1</tt>'s padding.&nbsp; Implication: if each of <tt>X1</tt>,
<tt>X2</tt>,
<tt>X3</tt>
consists of a single <tt>char</tt>, we can expect that <tt>sizeof(Y)</tt>
is considerably larger than <tt>3*sizeof(char) + sizeof(int)</tt>.&nbsp;
(Rationale: simplifies the handling of the subobjects.&nbsp; We can freely
use bitwise copying, which copies the base class padding areas as well
as their data members.&nbsp; If we didn't include the padding in the derived
classes, we'd have to make sure to handle an <tt>X1</tt> subobject more
carefully than a standalone <tt>X1</tt> object.)</li>

<li>
No special handling for empty base classes.</li>
</ul>
Sun solution:&nbsp;same as above, except they do have special handling
for empty base classes.&nbsp; An empty base class takes up no space in
the complete class, except that no other instance of the same empty class
will be allocated at the same offset.

<a name=vfunc>
<h2> Virtual functions and a single base class </h2>

A class with virtual functions differs in two ways.&nbsp; First, it has
a type id tag for the RTTI mechanism.&nbsp; Second, it has a virtual function
table (vtbl) and a virtual function pointer (vptr).&nbsp; This isn't required
by the C++ standard, but everyone does it this way.
<p>A virtual function table is a table of function addresses,&nbsp; If
a class <tt>X</tt> has three virtual functions <tt>f</tt>, <tt>g</tt>,
and <tt>h</tt>, then the addresses of those virtual functions appear at
fixed offsets, known at compile time, from the beginning of the vtbl.&nbsp;
A vtbl is one-per-class, not one-per-object.&nbsp; Each object of type
<tt>X</tt>
has a vptr, a pointer to the single <tt>X</tt> vtbl.
<p>(Implication: a class with virtual functions can never be empty.&nbsp;
Even if the user declares no data members, it always contains a vptr data
member.)
<p>If class <tt>Y</tt> is derived from class <tt>X</tt>, then <tt>Y</tt>'s
vtbl puts <tt>f</tt>, <tt>g</tt>, and <tt>h</tt> in the same slots as <tt>X</tt>'s
vtbl did.&nbsp; Any additional virtual functions introduced in <tt>Y</tt>
come later.&nbsp; That is, anyone who is expecting a pointer
<br>to the beginning of <tt>X</tt>'s vtbl and get a pointer to the beginning
of <tt>Y</tt>'s vtbl instead won't get any surprises.
<p>An object of class <tt>Y</tt> has two vptrs, one for the <tt>X</tt>
subobject (a subobject always has the same layout as a standalone object
of the same type) and one for the <tt>Y</tt> object itself.&nbsp; While
<tt>X</tt>'s
constructor is being run, the <tt>X</tt> subobject's vptr points to <tt>X</tt>'s
vptr.&nbsp; While <tt>Y</tt>'s constructor is being run, and for the remainder
of the object's lifetime, both of the <tt>Y</tt> object's vptrs point to
<tt>Y</tt>'s
vtbl.
<p>A virtual function call is just like an ordinary member call, except
that the call is through a function pointer in the vtbl.&nbsp; For example
if <tt>p</tt> is of type <tt>X*</tt> and if <tt>f</tt> is a member function
that takes a single argument of type <tt>int</tt>, then the expression
<tt>p->f(5)</tt>
is implemented as something like this:
<br><tt>(*(p->__vptr[__VTBL_OFFSET_OF_f]))(p, 5)</tt>.&nbsp; This is all
done on the caller side.&nbsp; The callee, <tt>f</tt>, need know nothing
about it.
<p>(Note: it is essential that this all be done on the caller side.&nbsp;
In some cases the function resolution can be performed at compile time.&nbsp;
If we are to allow the virtual function mechanism to be bypassed in such
cases, virtual functions and nonvirtual functions must use the same calling
convention.)
<p>Issues:
<ol>
<li>
What is the name of the vptr data member, here shown as <tt>__vptr</tt>?</li>

<li>
What is the location of the vptr relative to the class's other data members?&nbsp;
(Usual answer: either it's the first data member, or it's the last.)</li>

<li>
There is a single vtbl for each virtual-function-containing class, meaning
that the vtbl is emitted only in a single translation unit.&nbsp; Which
one?</li>

<li>
What is the exact layout of entries within a vtbl?</li>
</ol>
Sun:&nbsp;the vtbl is a static data member called __vtbl.&nbsp; The vptr
is at offset 0 within the class.&nbsp; In the vtbl, offset 0 is for RTTI;
it is the address of a function called _RT returning a <tt>const type_info*</tt>.&nbsp;
Offset 1 is unused except for base class subobjects within derived class
objects.&nbsp; It is the offset of the subobject from the beginning of
the complete object.&nbsp; (See below for why this is needed.)&nbsp; The
remaining indices are allocated to virtual functions in this order:&nbsp;first,
virtual functions from the leftmost immediate base class, with the same
index assignments as in the base; then virtual functions from other base
classes; then virtual functions newly declared in the derived class.&nbsp;
Index -1 is unused.&nbsp; Ordering of virtual base class pointers:&nbsp;first
the ones along the leftmost path, in depth-first order, then the other
virtual base classes, in depth-first, left-to-right order.

<h2>
Virtual functions and multiple base classes</h2>
If <tt>Y</tt> inherits from <tt>X1</tt> and <tt>X2</tt>, then either the
<tt>X1</tt>
or the <tt>X2</tt> subobject begins at the same address as the full Y object.&nbsp;
Let's say, for argument's sake, that it's the
<tt>X1</tt> subobject.&nbsp;
That means that whenever we have an <tt>X2*</tt> that points to an <tt>X2</tt>
subobject, and we need to convert it to a
<tt>Y*</tt> pointing to the full
<tt>Y</tt> object, we need to subtract some fixed offset.&nbsp; That's
fine if the user is performing an explicit cast; the difficulty is what
happens when the conversion is part of the virtual function mechanism.&nbsp;
A virtual member function invoked through an <tt>X2*</tt> can yield a <tt>Y</tt>
member function, and the first argument of a <tt>Y</tt> member function
(provided automatically by the compiler) must be a <tt>Y*</tt>.&nbsp; This
means there must be a mechanism to perform the <tt>X2*</tt> to <tt>Y*</tt>
adjustment automatically whenever it's needed for virtual function calls.
<p>Cfront solution: A vtbl is no longer a table of addresses, but a table
of pairs: address and offset.&nbsp; The vtbl for the <tt>Y</tt> itself
and for its <tt>X1</tt> subobjects are no longer the same.&nbsp; They contain
the same function addresses, but different offsets.&nbsp; Note that we
now have two vtbls for <tt>Y</tt> rather than 1, and that each one is twice
as large.
<p>Sun solution: Thunks.&nbsp; A vtbl entry can be a stub that performs
pointer adjustment and then jumps to the appropriate virtual function.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The multiple vtbls are merged into one; a secondary vtbl is accessed as
a fixed offset from the start of the primary.&nbsp; One additional optimization:&nbsp;the
vptr is stored at offset 0 from the beginning of the class, and base class
subobjects are layed out in declaration order.&nbsp; If the class's leftmost
immediate base has a vptr, and if it is a non-virtual base class or a virtual
base class with zero size, then it is allocated at zero offset so that
the base and derived class can share a vptr.
<p>IBM and Microsoft also use thunks, with some differences.&nbsp; (Caller/callee
issues.)&nbsp; Microsoft's thunk mechanism is patented. Thunks, or something
like them, are needed anyway for another reason.&nbsp; An overriding virtual
function can sometimes have a different type than the virtual function
in the base class.&nbsp; ("Covariant return types.")&nbsp; If a derived
class virtual function is invoked through a base class pointer, there are
cases where fixup on the return value is necessary.
<p>Issue:&nbsp;special handling for a class that only uses single inheritance?
<p>(TO DO: describe pointer-to-member layout.&nbsp; A pointer-to-member
must be a struct, not just a single address or offset.&nbsp; This is critical
for ABI&nbsp;compatibility.)

<h2>
Virtual base classes</h2>
Virtual base classes are very complicated, and implementation techniques
vary widely. The point of a virtual base class is if class <tt>Y</tt> inherits
from classes <tt>X1</tt> and <tt>X2</tt>, where <tt>X1</tt> and <tt>X2</tt>
both have a virtual base class <tt>A</tt>, then <tt>Y</tt> has only one
<tt>A</tt>
subobject, not two.&nbsp; This means that we can't use the same class layout
as we described above: the <tt>X1</tt> and <tt>X2</tt> subobjects can't
both have <tt>A</tt> subobjects the same way that standalone
<tt>X1</tt>
and <tt>X2</tt> objects would.
<p>The basic idea, which is common to all implementations, is that if a
class <tt>X1</tt> has a virtual base class <tt>A</tt>, the location of
the <tt>A</tt> subobject within an <tt>X1</tt> object can vary.&nbsp; (It
varies depending on whether the <tt>X1</tt> object is a standalone object
or a subobject.)&nbsp; Somewhere, then, at some fixed location, we need
to store a pointer or offset so that the <tt>A</tt> subobject&nbsp; can
be found at runtime.
<p>Cfront solution:
<ul>
<li>
Virtual base class subobjects go at the end of the derived class object,
in declaration order.&nbsp; In the example above, a <tt>X1</tt> object
would consist of <tt>X1</tt>'s own members, followed by an <tt>A </tt>subobject.

<tt>X2</tt> would have similar layout.&nbsp; <tt>Y</tt> would consist
of an <tt>X1</tt> subobject (without the <tt>A</tt> subobject), followed
by an <tt>X2</tt> subobject, followed by a shared <tt>A</tt> subobject.</li>

<li>
Each derived class object contains a pointer to the virtual base class
subobject.&nbsp; So, for example, <tt>X1</tt> would contain a <tt>__vbc_A</tt>
pointer of type <tt>A*</tt>.&nbsp; A <tt>Y</tt> object would contain three
such pointers, one for the Y itself and one for each of the <tt>X1</tt>
and <tt>X2</tt> subobjects.&nbsp; These pointers are set up in the constructor.</li>
</ul>
Sun solution: similar, except that what's stored is offsets instead of
pointers.&nbsp; That makes it possible for this information to be pulled
out of the objects themselves and put into the vtbl.&nbsp; Objects are
thus smaller than in the cfront model, and constructors don't have to initialize
any vbv pointers.&nbsp; In Sun's implementation, virtual member functions
have positive indices in the vtbl and virtual base class offsets have negative
indices.&nbsp; That may just be for backward compatibility with their old
ABI; the solution would be essentially the same if the entries were instead
interleaved.
<p>Issue:&nbsp;is there any reason to have special handling for an empty
virtual base class?
<p>(TO DO: describe pointer-to-member layout.&nbsp; Converting a pointer-to-data-member
in a virtual base class into a pointer-to-data-member of a derived class
requires runtime fixup.)
